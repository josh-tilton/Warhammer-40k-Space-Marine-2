76561198050419580,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050419580/,"Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",Recommended,3661,53.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 10
76561198014929285,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014929285/,"Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",Recommended,2920,26.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

It's sad that I have to say this, but it's wonderfully refreshing to be able to boot up a game, play for an hour or two, and close it again. Rather than boot it up, do my dailies, check my weeklies, check my season pass etc.

userpig,https://steamcommunity.com/id/userpig/,"Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed me the error of my ways and made me cast away the heresy and fully embrace the Emperor's glorious light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance, for Space Marine 2 has torn asunder the veil that clouded my mortal sight.

With each righteous strike of the chainsword, I felt the will of the Emperor coursing through my veins. The xenos or the heretic—none can stand before the might of the Adeptus Astartes, and now I, too, feel the weight of that sacred duty upon my shoulders. Every battle is a prayer to His undying majesty, every victory a testament to the purity of the Emperor's cause.

In this game, I learned what it truly means to be a warrior of the Imperium: to purge the unclean without hesitation, to stand unwavering in the face of annihilation, and to know that failure is not an option, for failure would mean the death of mankind itself. This is no mere entertainment—this is an initiation into the sacred brotherhood of those who fight for the survival of the Imperium.

Space Marine 2 is not just a game—it is a revelation, a holy writ in digital form, and a reminder that we must be ever vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to cleanse the galaxy of those who would defy the Emperor's will.

76561197968514473,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/,"""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.”

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.

Pros & cons:

++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: „We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.“ Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactive’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devs’ transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your team’s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.

🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons
• Impressive visuals with lore-accurate art direction. The brutality and bleakness of the 40K universe are masterfully conveyed.

• Superb combat system that equally rewards skill, resource conservation and a tactical, team-oriented approach.

• Solid variety of enemies, all of which have unique behaviors, movesets and abilities.

• Bosses that evolve their movesets dynamically, and are highly challenging on the harder settings.

• The 40K lore is accurately transposed and faithful to the series canon.

• Enjoyable, well-written storyline, compounded by plausible characters and interesting events. • AI companions aren’t smart enough for complex objectives, and can’t be ordered around or customized.

• Balancing issues make some weapons redundant or useless.

• Campaign progress isn't saved if you complete a mission in co-op but you aren't the host.

• PvE progression is excessively grindy compared to the variety of content it offers; it does get repetitive.







“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it unenjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty of SM2. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.

The superb combat system of SM2 is articulate and skill-based, fully conveying the brutality of conflicts of such a scale and, on the higher difficulties, the lethality of Mankind’s enemies. With one melee and two ranged weapons, you’ll lay waste to all Xenos, but you’ll also need to be careful, as a few hits are all that’s needed (on the higher difficulties) to be slain. A responsive system of dodge, parry and riposte rewards timing and reflexes, restoring your armor so that your health isn’t affected — the latter only restored by special abilities or rare consumable Stimms.

Each enemy is dangerous and behaves coherently to their role, even the lesser ones pose a threat, given their sheer numbers — heavier ones, especially mini-bosses, might even one-shot you given the chance, and their endurance is superior. A substantial array of iconic weapons, from the Bolter in its variants to the mighty Thunder Hammer, Plasma Guns and the devastating Krak Grenades will all become available to you as the story progresses — they’re not infinite however, so use your ammunition wisely. SM2 encourages aggressive playstyles with its armor regen mechanics, as slaying enemies in melee with perfect parries not only will bolster your defenses and allow devastating counters, but also allow the use of your Ultimate ability, making you unstoppable and regenerate health for a short time.

Fights are high-stakes, packed with gore and exciting, with a system that is nearly-perfectly designed for this genre. Unfortunately, your companions, mighty as they may be, will be too dumb to properly assume the best positioning during defense tasks, and can’t be equipped with custom loadouts, unlike yourself. Bosses are all unique, barring a few repeating ones, and extremely difficult to overcome on the harder settings. Their tactics change as they lose health, and usually only a few hits from them spell your doom.

After the Campaign, you’ll have several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.",Recommended,5448,54.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.
At the end of the campaign there is an open ending in which Titus is sent to another place temporarily which we can see in a future sequel of the game or a future DLC.

flashn00b,https://steamcommunity.com/id/flashn00b/,"The Strongest 40K game for the Strongest Day
For anyone with even the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, this game's arguably the best Warhammer 40,000 title to release after the bankruptcy of THQ, after 13 years of getting a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that between 2018 and Boltgun's release, the best way to enjoy the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium in video games was honestly to create Space Marines in SoulCalibur VI. I'll admit i've only played the first missions of the main story and the co-op campaign respectively, though my first impressions of the game have me confident that I'm gonna get a lot of enjoyment from the rest of it.

Gameplay
Being a continuation of Relic Entertainment's Space Marine, combat is meant to have you split your attention between melee and ranged combat, and I feel like Saber Interactive did a much better job at making melee more viable compared to SM1, and I think the dodging and parrying mechanics were the main things that buffed the game's melee, cuz I remember that using your chainsword in the first game was a very fast way to get got by the Ork Boyz and Nobs, often really only being used in the campaign's jump pack sections.

One thing which I can already tell that people miss is SM1's health system. While I personally don't have issues with how health is handled in SM2, I feel like they could've introduced a temporary health mechanic similar to L4D's pain pills for the executions, cuz the armor blips tend to not last very long in the face of your ankles being bitten by multiple hormagaunts, and fodder enemies can be equated to death by a thousand paper cuts. This is a minor nitpick on my end, though one thing I've found from the first half of the second mission is a harsher criticism.

While other games might enjoy putting the player in a forced turret section, Space Marine 2 has forced flamethrower sections, where the game leaves a Pyreblaster near a door to inform the player that they will have to fight against Rippers, small legless creatures that are about the size of a house cat, but swarm you in the hundreds of thousands. It's annoying enough that firing the weapon slows your walking speed significantly, though the fact that they deal pathetically low damage is needless frustration, especiallly since the smaller mortal-sized flamers have been proven to be effective against Hormagaunt and (former) human alike in other forms of Warhammer 40,000 media.

Moving onto the co-op Operations mode, this to me feels like the co-op experience that fans have been craving since the days of the first Space Marine game. Though I've only really played the Vanguard, I found it to be a pretty solid experience, though I personally wish they added a Firstborn class in the game. To those unaware, Games Workshop has been trying to redesign the Space Marine identity from the ground up, though certain weapons from the earlier days of Warhammer 40,000 are unavailable to the modern depictions of the Adeptus Astartes.

With Warhammer 40K being full of intricate gothic architecture you'd expect to find in a fantasy setting with the first antagonist you fight being a swarm of buglike creatures that hope to overwhelm you with their numbers, I think it's fair to expect a hardware-intense game. With the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X targeting 1440p and 30FPS, it's fair to say that it's a pretty demanding game. I'm personally on a Ryzen 3800X and RTX 3070, and while i'm on 1080p myself, the game typically hovers around 50-81 FPS, though there are occasionally some dips down to 41 in moments of high activity. While demanding, I wouldn't call it unstable since in the 6 hours I've clocked in so far, I've actually only had one crash, which is a huge improvement from how frequently the leaked build would crash on the same machine. I don't think more modest machines can realistically target 60fps without utilizing the game's built-in upscaling options, though I think the Dynamic Resolution option isn't functional.

Those who have spent a lot of time personalizing their Space Marine in the first game are gonna be let down with the second one. With Games Workshop trying to push the Primaris Space Marines as the new face of Warhammer 40,000, the number of options available to customize your looks has been severely neutered, to such a degree they had to make colors and emblems unlockable. It's especially egregious in my personal opinion that the fully sealed Mk X Phobos helmet isn't in the game, since that at least is a callback to the old scowl helmets from the pre-9th Edition days of Warhammer 40K.

While we might never get a chance to beat up those holier-than-thou knife-ears that Guilliman seems so attracted to these days, Space Marine 2 is definitely one of those games where an admittedly painful wait turned out to actually be worth the delay it ate, which is a welcome surprise when you consider that game delays in current year are a sign of the dev team thinking that their game's an absolute dumpster fire, especially with 40K. Do i think that this game will be the standard that other devs will follow when handling the license? Unfortunately, no. With that said, I think the June 2024 leak has proven to be a blessing in disguise, and I hope that Saber would at least consider releasing the prologue and first mission for free as a post-release demo.",Recommended,4437,17.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 10
gdiverge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiverge/,"What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

I do understand that people are struggling with some issues here, but for me it was a smooth 9 hours sailing from the main menu to the end titles bar a few toilet breaks.

Space Marine 2 is a perfect sequel like Uncharted 2 was to Uncharted 1. It is a living, breathing and brilliatntly realized vision of 40k universe in all it's gory glory and spectacular epicness. I can't find porper words to describe how perfect and true to the setting almost every detail and element is.

We've never seen WH40k universe realized with such care, fidelity and production quality. Never. This is the best WH40k media to date and the closest to the huge Warhammer 40k movie we're all dreaming about.

Travesura,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,"TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.

The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play).

Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters.

There is also the 6vs6 PvP mode, which is really cool. Progression is pretty good, and you want to keep playing to unlock the next weapons and cosmetics, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps and 3 game modes at the moment.

twiig,https://steamcommunity.com/id/twiig/,"Review After 100% Achievements

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and I’m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was good…not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isn’t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launch….I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since I’d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

cureton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cureton/,"At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.

The season pass only holding cosmetics. No pesky microtransactions, time savers, or any other games as service BS. The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals.

CAMPAIGN:
This is a excellent addition to the Warhammer 40K Gaming Universe. The creative team did a great job at providing a fresh story experience while building on the narrative of the original. You really do learn to appreciate and fight with your squad by the end. I could go on at length, but the Emperors work is best experienced rather than described. Take up your weapon and purge the enemies of Man!!!

+ Combat is fluid and dynamic.
+ Excellent variety of weapons
+ Action and design of gameplay, characters an d plot feel true to the setting.
+ Truly breathtaking environment design ... This wholly immerses you in the monumental scale of

- I preferred the shield and health system from the first game, but this is fine once you adapt to it.
- They removed dodge rolling, now dodge is more of a standard scoot to the side :( (But effective)
(+/-) Jump-pack feels slowed down vs the first game, but has significantly more utility so YMMV.

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play!",Recommended,2548,24.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

1supersecretagentman1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1supersecretagentman1/,"I think the game is great, but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention. I understand they had people to please by releasing it this early, but it could've used more time in the oven, as a bad launch can really sour a game's reputation (looking at you Darktide). I'd like to get my grievances out of the way before I name the positives.

Firstly, requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange, and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up. And not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release. You can't choose lobbies, you can't choose to host or join them, and you can't opt for a solo run; even worse, there is ZERO reconnecting to a match if you aren't playing w friends. If you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match, you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress. And on top of that, there is no kick prevention late into a match, so if you really wanted to kick at the very end, you could.

Second, it has terrible optimization all round; it loads horribly slow without an SSD, I have it on an NVME and it still loads slow sometimes. Performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 FPS no matter what. I have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn't keep 60 FPS, it routinely drops to 40, not to mention any mid-range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios.

Third, is the combat system. It ALMOST feels good. Small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever, armor sustain feels weird in it's current implementation, and so does HP sustain. The whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine, but there is almost no way to sustain HP outside of the overheal bug, and Apothecary/Bulwark's ultimate ability, 99% of the lobbies I queue on Ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance. You should get a 5% heal for majoris executions and 10% for extremis, and like 15-20% for terminus. That and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree. Armor should have to chipped away by small enemies, it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors. And we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation, at reasonable frames, as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations. Parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too. being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes.

The good stuff here has serious potential. The combat when it DOES work, feels awesome. There is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you. The inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game (save the dodge roll. Astartes would not GoW dodge roll, the Bulwark side step looks apt though), Between the Doom executions, the Gears of War combat style, and the spawn waves akin to the Tide games (elites, mini bosses, specials, chaff units. Which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic Left for Dead formula) they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and SOMETIMES, difficulty. I like this game, but I would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes. They have the framework up already, so if they really care about their players, they'd make some number changes. Combat is a super easy fix. Matchmaking too. The optimization might take them longer.

Overall, get this game if you think it looks fun, but only if you have decent internet, and an mid to high end PC.",Recommended,2982,81.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 15
kozzy420,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/,"Positives:
- Some of the best graphics around
- Wonderful melee combat and good gun combat to
- Voice acting is done well
- Music and other audio is done good
- Decent story
- A great lean and very fun campaign with no filler
- Performance for me was good the whole game, never below 60fps w everything cranked
- No crashes during the whole campaign
- Addicting gameplay
- Atmosphere is great, with so many enemies around feels like a real war
- Fun Coop
- No BS in the game, just a good old fashioned kicking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ videogame
- Level design is awesome
- TONS of enemies everywhere!

Negatives:
- Campaign could have had another mission or 2
- The only mission I didn't like was the flying around in space, although short it wasn't needed
- Please allow people to have the same class in COOP, very annoying to have to switch


These are my thoughts so far after only beating the campaign, going to try some Coop next and maybe a little PVP but I don't see myself playing a ton of that. I will def be coming back to this game to in the future when more Coop missions are added and especially when the Horde mode is added, that should be wonderful fun with how good this combat system is.

Def one of the best Warhammer games to date, probably tied with GOW2 as my favorite all time Warhammer game and has made me reinstall GOW2, Hired Gun & Darktide again to get some more Warhammer action in, very good game and one of 2024's best without a doubt (Probably #3 on my top 10 list this year).

I do love my big epic, super long rpgs but I do love when a well done lean and mean campaign comes around that is about 7-8 hours and very well done. No filler, no extra bs, just get down to business and that is alot of fun. Well done to the devs, they nailed the Warhammer feel very well. As good as the first Space Marine game was, this is a good deal better imo, better graphics, combat is better and it has a more epic feel to it. Pretty much Space Marine 1 with classic Gears of War mix in, fantastic campaign overall.

FOR THE EMPEROR!

**Tried a Coop mission, it was great fun, hectic gameplay and cool character creator/customization and leveling up to. Just wish you could be the same class as your friend, instead of having to switch. For PVP I can see having that in maybe, but not in Coop**",Recommended,1879,8.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

mikvsl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mikvsl/,"A 13 year long wait for a game that delivered correctly on what it needed to do but not on what people may have expected.

SM2 at its best is another great addition to the highly loved horde shooter genre with a WH40K coat of paint on it, with my high love for WH40K it was a great journey to go through this game and be genuinely in awe over environment work and how being a space marine should truly feel.

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

Of course with a game like this it is expected that people will get tired of doing the same thing over and over with the minimal amount of content based inside PvE and PVP on launch, for what it is im already 30-40 hours in and still finding fun in spending time making myself look amazing with customization and PVP every now and then.

Honestly, the first half of the campaign didn’t grab me as much as I expected. I initially thought it aimed to be a 40K [Space Marine] version of the other fellow Warhammer titles like Darktide and Vermintide but the Focus Entertainment version of them given the tricks it also borrowed from A Plague Tale and Aliens: Fireteam Elite. That would have been an overstatement for sure. Saber Interactive is turbulent as a developer but they did a solid job here.

While the Tyranid invasion dominates most of the game, and it ultimately means facing hive-mind swarms, the game flowed better once Chaos elements started to involve in the story. When you start sparring off against the Adeptus Mechanicus, the pacing improves. Although I dislike certain objectives in SM2, such as ""Hold off against the enemies until X is completed,"" they are acceptable for a standard TPS shooter campaign as long as the game flows well. And well, SM2 does flow. It features strong moment-to-moment gameplay, with frequent switches between melee and ranged combat, making it a good hybrid of hack-and-slash and shooter. The campaign also include a somewhat enjoyable final boss to end it all, intense action sequences, and varied elements like platforming and jetpack usage, reminiscent of the first game. There are even gameplay sequences involving a flamethrower against swarming rats. Sounded familiar? :)

The campaign (and by extension, PvE missions) has scarce supplies, especially in terms of aids. On higher difficulties, you need to use melee combat to fend off large groups of enemies [minoris] to conserve ammo, while also keeping an eye on Majoris enemies that provide armor upon execution. Executing these enemies requires parries and melee chains, which might remind you of Doom Eternal. Engaging in combat and switching tactics is often rewarding in SM2. My only small complaint is that there should have been a way to replenish health, similar to Doom Eternal. PvE is where the difficulty is to be more relied as you have only a few chances to be revived before you ultimately doomed to fail. In campaign even if you play one of the higher 2 difficulties you rarely worry about that and your companions are almost unbeatable because they are simply there to revive you and their health rarely goes low. From time to time I thought running a co-op campaign at the highest difficulty would have been much harder as my partner sucked more than the AI, lol. The scarcity in co-op becomes much more evident as the game would offer only 2 health packages at most although it would offer a cache to replenish ammo infinitely- again in a similar fashion to Aliens: Fireteam Elite.

PvE missions offer limited replayability unless you aim to master them on higher difficulties and grind for cosmetics. Which I really did not want to but it ends up being a personal thing. However, six PvE missions at launch isn’t too bad. Completing each mission adds another 3 to 6 hours of gameplay, which I appreciated. They had variety, though the environments and enemies are recycled. Some moments in these missions would have been great additions to the campaign (such as the Drake fight). I view PvE missions as an extension of the campaign, and with promises of more enemies and maps in the future, I hope PvE content will become more diverse and intriguing over time.

PvP was unplayable during my pre-release playthrough, and I haven't had enough time to explore it post-release. You use the same classes in both PvP and PvE, though you can customize them differently for each mode. The PvP is a 6v6 battle—far from perfect, but even with limited play, I found it to be a mode worth revisiting occasionally. Matches are quick, taking around 10 minutes, and the flow is smooth. SM2 currently lacks a battle pass or premium system for unlocking cosmetics, offering only free content and some season pass content throughout the year. So, there’s no fear of missing out. If SM2's PvP were a standalone mode, it might barely suffice, but as an addition to the main game, it feels fairly generous. It’s reminiscent of beloved 2010s multiplayer modes that came with a campaign, like TLOU’s Factions if you take a moment to recognize how beloved it was for a simple additional mp mode.

The visual fidelity and art design are standout features in this game. SM2 effectively captures the depth and the scale of Warhammer 40K universe with some of the most visually pleasing environments I’ve seen, despite being set in a war-torn setting. There are almost no janky parts, and everything executes well, including the execution animations. The bloodbath during intense combat is gratifying, and the sound design is excellent, with each weapon having a distinctive sound that enhances the experience of firing a bolt carbine to a multi-meta or swinging a thunder hammer.

The optimization isn’t the best, but I managed to get 40-50 FPS most of the time with a 3080 Ti/12700KF setup, playing on High presets with DLSS set to Balanced. I’ve seen worse, so I’ll take it.

76561198156021248,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156021248/,"I have been wanting to play a sequel to Space Marine since the first game launched in 2011. To finally be able to play the sequel to it was fantastic! I love everything about Space Marines and the game in general so I bought the Ultra Edition of the game instantly so nothing would be spoiled for me via the internet.

Was the wait for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 worth it? Is it a good game? Is it a worthy successor to Space Marine (1)? Yes. Yes it was and I am glad I paid to play early because I loved and still am, currently loving everything about the game. Below I will explain why I am loving Space Marine 2 but first, a quick disclaimer!



⚫In terms of optimisation - the game has no lag, stutter, fps drops, freezing e.t.c. Space Marine 2 is technically not out yet as of writing this review (paid to play early) and the game runs smoother than butter. Is this because Denuvo DRM is not on the game? Probably.
⚫The visuals/Graphic are beyond AMAZING and even on low specs, they look stunning.
⚫Fighting off the THOUSANDS of Tyranids that are coming to turn you into a bloody gore pit on the floor was PHENOMENAL. Watching them make the ""pyramid"" to climb up the walls and you punch, shoot, crush, stomp - OBLITERATE them from the face of the planet... the gore, the blood, the animations... all of which are so spot on.
⚫The game has a LORE-ACCURATE art direction which ANY 40k fan will respect and to top that off the lore is accurate and faithful to true canon lore. Compared to some ""recent"" 40k games - Space Marine 2 is the BEST Warhammer game to be released in over a decade.
⚫The combat system is stellar. Ranging from melee weapons to ranged weapons that work so fluently together in the heat of battle. Doing the melee combos to stun and then being able to point your gun - executioner style to kill them... felt so good.
⚫Enemy variety will keep you on your toes almost at all times. Not only are they ""unique"" they all have their own behaviours and abilities which will put your skills to the test of a true Space Marine.
⚫On harder difficulties the enemies seem to dynamically change their movesets (either this is true or I suck on veteran+) and, I am not kidding here, will TRULY test your skills. Harder difficulty campaign (or ops) will be a true test of player skill as you need to perfect your dodging and parrying ability because in the end - this show the true lethality of mankind's enemies in the 40k universe.
⚫The story was very well written and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It had interesting moments, moments where you would be like ""oh no"" or ""FOR THE OMNISIAH!!!"". Not only that, the characters were very well embedded in the story which only enhanced the story even more.
⚫Once you are finished with campaign missions you can play the OPERATIONS MODE (PVE) which run parallel to the base games campaign which has you playing as a different ultramarine squad that lets you level up weapons and several class's. Not only is this mode FANTASTIC, the progression feels rewarding as the longer you go, the harder it gets and more XP you will earn, ontop of that you will earn UNIQUE cosmetics that other players may or may not be able to obtain (as I said, skill based combat).
⚫If PVE mode is not your thing, don't fret! You also gain access to ENDLESS WAR (PVP) which pits Space Marines against the Chaos forces. It brings back the classic game modes such as Deathmatch which I am sure we all know how fun that was in Space Marine! Not only that, if you are struggling to get perks and weapons unlocked in PVP you can just go play PVE for a bit as PVP shares PVE's loadout customisation options.
⚫It has tonnes of content still yet to be released - look at the roadmap. Horde mode.... come on, who doesn't just want to sit and kill thousands, if not millions, of Tyranids for the Emperors name!

⚫The main issue that people are mentioning is the ""servers"" struggling at the moment - I have noticed this issue only seems to happen if you are playing COOP campaign or ONLINE modes - You can spend about 5-10 minutes on the ""loading"" screen to only realise that the game is not loading at all and this forces you to restart your game. If you are in Campaign, you will most likely loose all mission progress if you are the COOP partner or miss an important cutscene. This means you might have to replay the mission you had just played.
⚫You cannot order your AI team to do anything. Open a door. Press a button. Heal you. They are a bit ""stupid"" to say the least. Hey, no games perfect.
⚫There are no collectables or ""secrets"" to be found. Only Dataslates. I am mentioning this in cons because I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to add little secrets about ""past"" events or ""past"" games that have released.
⚫About the point above - there is no point in really exploring as there is nothing to see or find. Just the dataslates and even at that they are not really hidden at all. The maps were very linear full of dead-ends, wished there was a little more ""exploring"" to be had.

In the end, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is probably the best Warhammer game in a decade. Not only is it faithful to it's lore, it had practically no stutter, lag, fps drops at all, the animations are spot on, the characters are spot on, the world building and story writing were superb... this is what Warhammer should be like when you make it a game!!!

I wholeheartedly, after waiting almost 14/15 years for a new Space Marine game to come out... say this game should be played by everyone, new or old to the 40K universe.",Recommended,4552,36.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

khornebrzrkr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/khornebrzrkr/,"Much like with Star Wars, when a good Warhammer game comes along, you have to hold onto it with both hands.

Space Marine 2 is not an Oscar-winning performance. The dialog in the campaign mode won't have you pondering the (super)human condition and the plot contrivances aren't all that original. The premise of the campaign is even a mirror to the original game's hook, which you could see as good or bad.

But the thing about Titus' story is that you can see the struggle he's dealing with if you know where to look. Sadly that probably won't happen if this is your first 40k game, but it IS a sequel, after all. A player with background knowledge of who Titus is as a man, and who he has to be as a space marine, can see the deep emotional turmoil he finds himself in, a man out of place after the events of the first SM game. The engaging and visceral combat, which is not keeping any secrets about itself, will have you fully believing that every big fight is for all the marbles. I particularly found myself trying as hard as I could to protect NPC imperial guardsmen wherever I found them from the hordes of Tyranids trying to reduce them to biofuel.

They also let you Paint Your Dudes. This is vitally important.

Space Marine 2 is probably the single greatest realization of what the world of Warhammer 40,000 would not only look, but move and sound like.

Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

I’ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - it’s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, it’s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then it’s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

Hearthwarning,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hearthwarning/,"Introduction

I always wanted to make my own space marine, color it, choose the chapter i want, play with but getting into the 40k Mini's is hard and expensive. But with this game you can immerse yourself in the world of 40k and be a Space Marine for US$60.

Regardless whether you're into 40K or not, if you like 3rd person shooter, fighting xenos (aliens) with 2 other people, that has a good Story Campaign, 6 different classes in Pve Operations mode, and a PVP, then this game is for you







So in conclusion, think it's a great game and a lot of fun to play with friends or random. This game had been a blast compared to previous 40K games, and it lives up and surpass the first Space Marine. Whether or not this game is worth it for those who want to buy it, is up to you.

Combat is extremely fun and engaging, PvP feels way more balanced than I initially expected, the game looks beautiful, and mostly runs great. Feels extremely accurate to the lore, the customization options are insane. The negatives are really just long load times, and while we know we're getting more operations and such, eventually running the same 6 will get a bit stale. However, the higher the difficulty, the more random encounters can happen, and makes the game more exciting, even when doing the same thing over and over.

teshkomije,https://steamcommunity.com/id/teshkomije/,"As a long-time fan of the Warhammer 40K universe and someone who enjoyed the original Space Marine, Space Marine 2 has completely blown me away!

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like you’re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 9/10
Performance 7/10

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",Recommended,2952,85.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider.

В один момент я готов был пищать от радости, а уже через полчаса закатывать глаза в недоумении. Если вам интересно, что пошло не так, что давайте тезисно и по порядку...

...Что понравилось

✅ Зрелищная боевая система, где банально приятно пинать жуков по морде железным сапогом.

✅ Крутой звуковой дизайн, благодаря которому чувствуешь мощь каждого выстрела и на слух понимаешь действия врагов в бою.

✅ Визуально — одна из красивейших современных игр, даже добавить нечего.

✅ На удивление прилично написанный сюжет и отличная работа с повествованием через окружение, позволяющая осознать всю хтонь сеттинга.

✅ Один из лучших русских игровых дубляжей за годы.

✅ Хорошая производительность, подводившая лишь в совсем убийственные для CPU моменты (У меня связка Ryzen 5600 и RTX 4070).


❌ Боевая система механически очень быстро выдыхается, оставляя игрока с чередой одинаковых арен с врагами.

❌ Всего две фракции противников, ограниченных в уникальных юнитах.

❌ Слишком много визуально однообразных видов оружия, в которых путаешься до конца игры.

❌ Жутко неудобное управление с клавиатуры в бою при неприятном ориентировании в меню с геймпада.

❌ Неткод оставляет желать лучшего и любит кидать игрока на сервера с высоким пингом или вечно реконектить соединение через чёрный экран.

❌ Долгие загрузки даже с NVM SSD.

❌ Игра балансилась под кооператив, поэтому возникают пики сложности при игре в одиночку, ибо боты-напарники просто не обучены ничему кроме стрельбы и реанимации игрока.

❌ PvE-режим операций выдыхается так же быстро, как и боевая система, не предлагая чего-то интересней получасовой пробежки по аренам с врагами.

❌ PvP-режим будто сделан ради рофла и даже не тестировался.

❌ Излишне долгая прокачка классов в мультиплеере.


Space Marine 2 невероятно красивая и тактильно приятная игра, в которую становится неинтересно играть уже на пятый час геймплея из-за отсутствия глубины в боевой системе и однообразия игровых ситуаций. Мультиплеерные режимы в свою очередь никуда не годятся в качестве эндгейм-контента. Мне крайне трудно рекомендовать игру за полный ценник, но обязательно вернитесь на распродажах, ведь это всё ещё самый смачный боевик в сеттинге 40К и неплохое кооперативное развлечение.",Recommended,1974,22.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

i love 40k and have been anticipating this game for so long.

The campaign is short but cinematic AF. Visuals, game play, the sound is all on point!

The PVP just feels meh to me, it doesn't really offer much at the moment.

So the reason i'm on the fence, Whats going to keep me coming back for more?
I mean, i've completed the campaign and the side missions. So basically all that's left for me to do is rinse and repeat on higher difficulties to level up my brother, for what? So i can just log in and be like, wow he looks awesome. For me the eternal war should of been more like a hell divers type of mode, drop in and defend planets from different races. just hoping that they bring in some new modes to keep it playable.

Well that's my view anyway.",Recommended,667,29.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

Space Marine 2 isn't just good, it is phenomenal. It is one of the best action games ever made. I cannot recommend it enough. If you missed old-school games where you just played the game, it's for you. There are no absurd skill trees, open worlds, or other BS, just pure game. I missed that.

If you don't know about Warhammer, don't worry. You don't need to know anything about it. But I would recommend watching a short recap of the first game because it's direct sequel.",Recommended,413,20.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 5
arcvox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcvox/,"Space Marine 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, improving on the original game in almost every aspect. As it currently stands, I think it's a great game and represents the 40K universe very well, capturing grand scale combat zones on gorgeous alien planets. That said, it can certainly do with some quality of life improvements, which is to be expected of most new games out the gate. Hopefully they will address certain issues quite quickly, though most of these didn't affect the game in a negative way. More details on that below.

The game itself follows the story from the first game, which was a fairly basic story about the discovery of a relic which brings about nothing but trouble for the protagonist, Titus. Essentially, he is paying penance for his ""crime"" in the last game, which consists of him not dying. As a result of this, he has grown distrustful of his fellow brothers, which in turn makes his brothers not trust him - along with the obvious fact that he mysteriously vanished for the last couple of centuries. The campaign takes place over 3 planets, while certain storyline events take place concurrently with the Operations game mode, which is essentially another 6 missions in co-op mode, where you can play as a custom Space Marine.

The gameplay is pretty basic. It's very similar to Gears of War without the cover system, instead relying on stunning and executing enemies to restore your overshields. You'll be mixing up melee and gun play mopping up large numbers of basic enemies while eliminating the larger threats, which mostly consist of two large factions each with around 6-7 enemy types each, and some boss type enemies too.

Overall, I do recommend this game, however I do feel that the amount of content itself is a little bit lacking. Saber have made a very good game platform for more content to be added, and I can imagine different scenarios and missions could easily be added to objective mode. Having completed the campaign, it definitely feels as though it's meant to be played co-op too, especially with all the cool cosmetics you can unlock in the multiplayer modes. These additions I feel like would be low effort for the developer, so maybe they will consider it in the future.

Other than the small quality of life improvements and a bit of tweaking on some of the multiplayer classes, I think Saber did an excellent job, and I look forward to more content. The storyline is gripping, the visuals are amazing, and it's the sort of fun gory gameplay that we used to get a lot of in gaming, so it's nice to have a callback to that.


- Excellent visuals that brings the 40K universe to life in an authentic way.
- Captures the essence of the Space Marines in all their glory (though on harder difficulties you won't feel very powerful at all)
- Impressive horde mechanics, particularly in their movement. Climbing up walls and scrambling over each other suits the tyranids amazingly.
- Combat is fairly basic but fun, and glory killing enemies never seems to get old.


- Gaining multiplayer XP is incredibly slow, given that you'll be repeating online content a fair bit. This is exacerbated by the fact that cosmetics use the same currency as productive upgrades such as perk points. I feel like the two should have been separated so you can work towards your favorite chapter AND progress in abilities so you can pull your weight better in teams.
- Melee in particular needs some buffs, as it tends to do little damage compared to firearms.
- Harder difficulties are quite overtuned at the moment. This is especially apparent against ranged enemies, who always seem to have a clear line of sight to your team and make extremely quick work of you while in combat.
- Missing some obvious and easy to implement quality of life improvements, such as a co-op campaign mode, customisable campaign armor sets using cosmetics from the multiplayer, and weapons carrying over from certain chapters. I noticed in the campaign, Titus regularly has his default armor and weapons, which is understandable in CGI cutscenes, but not in the in-game ones. Also, I would have preferred to have the helmets on the team for the custscenes too. There is an option for this, but it only affects gameplay moments.",Recommended,3524,19.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 16
wlsper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wlsper/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a game that millions of fans eagerly awaited for over a decade. After the success of the first part, expectations were through the roof. We were promised the next step in the evolution of one of Warhammer's most iconic characters, Captain Titus, and more epicness, more power fantasy, more... everything. But as it often happens in the world of game development, something got lost in translation, and here we are, staring at a game that could have been revolutionary but settles for being “good.”

The game nails its core action. The combat? Oh, it’s satisfying, don’t get me wrong. You can slice, shoot, and smash your way through hordes of Tyranids with the kind of visceral brutality that would make Khorne proud. Each swing of the chainsword feels weighty, and the executions? Pure Warhammer gory bliss. EMPEROR BLESS THE DEVASTATORS, LOVE IT! But... and this is where the cracks start to show.

The game is linear. Very linear. Most of the time, you’ll find yourself running from point A to point B, entering an arena, fighting waves of enemies, and repeating this loop until the credits roll. Where is the innovation? The variety? Why not throw in some Titan battles, give us a chance to pilot Space Marine tech? We’re supposed to be part of this massive, planet-spanning war, but it rarely feels like it. FFS tyranids, billions of them, give as!














The plot picks up with Captain Titus as he leads his fellow Space Marines against the xenos threat, in this case, the Tyranids. The game is set during a massive war, but the plot feels secondary to the combat. Warhammer 40K fans will appreciate the nods to the deep lore — the tensions between the Space Marines and Adeptus Mechanicus are a nice touch. However, the story, much like the gameplay, plays it safe. It’s there, but it doesn’t take any risks.

It’s essentially a continuation of Titus’ journey, but there’s no real depth to his arc. He’s the stoic, battle-hardened Space Marine we know and love, but by the end, you might find yourself wishing for something a bit more complex, more human even.


This is where the game’s true strength lies—and its biggest flaw. The combat is relentless, fast-paced, and satisfying. You’ll wade through hordes of enemies like a demigod, cutting them down with ease. The problem? That’s pretty much all there is to it. Move from point to point, clear the enemies, move on. Rinse and repeat.

There’s very little variety in how the missions are structured, and after a few hours, it starts to feel like you’re just going through the motions. The game desperately needed more epic set-pieces. Give us a Titan to control! Let us lead a squad of Space Marines in a massive, planet-wide assault! Instead, the game plays it safe, sticking to what worked in the first part but never truly expanding on it.

One of the most glaring missed opportunities is the lack of vehicle combat. Warhammer 40K is known for its massive machines of war, and yet we don’t get to pilot any of them. Where are the tanks? Where are the Thunderhawks? Where is the epic scale we expected?


Visually, the game is a treat. The environments are beautifully detailed, from the dark, gothic architecture to the alien-infested wastelands. Saber Interactive did a fantastic job bringing the Warhammer 40K universe to life. The sound design is equally impressive—chainswords hum with deadly energy, bolters roar with each shot, and the soundtrack sets the perfect tone for the carnage you’re about to unleash.


Is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 a bad game? No, far from it. It’s a fun, action-packed experience that will satisfy your need for some good old-fashioned Space Marine power fantasy. But is it the sequel we hoped for? Not quite. It feels like Space Marine 1 with a fresh coat of paint—more polished, but not more ambitious.

In today’s gaming market, where so many releases fall flat, this one at least delivers on its core promise: brutal, visceral action. But with more effort, it could have been so much more.

Verdict: 7/10

It’s not the masterpiece it could have been, but it’s still a damn good time. Just don’t expect anything revolutionary.",Recommended,3477,25.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Honestly got no idea about the space marine story or lore, but i did play some warhammer games such as vermintide 1, and 2, darktide, and this one currently.

Graphics wise the game looks great, some details are more focused on than others, but it is really nice looking.
Not sure why they went with 3 players co-op and not the usual 4 player majority of people got used to, but maybe they have their reasons.

Game running buttery smooth, 4k max settings, native resolution, no upscaling, 65+ fps all the time. PC specs 14900k, 4090, 64gb ram.

one thing they may need to improve on, but this might be due to my region, is that i dont have any nearby servers to join to, and this affects people like me in Middle East, as the least ping we saw was 87 or 94 ping, never lower.



i recommend buying the base for now and upgrade later if you feel like it. 8/10.

TheKharos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKharos/,"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",Recommended,3383,73.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

RoboticCamelid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RoboticCamelid/,"Product received for free

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it.

Pros:
+ Plenty of WH40k lore, references and easter eggs... Warhammer 40k fans will be pleased
+ Truly an epic campaign
+ Looks great
+ Gameplay is solid, brutal, bloody and gives a good challenge on higher difficulties
+ Soundtrack
+ 6 unique classes for PVE and PVP
+ Great optimazation
+ Polished, no bugs ( except Tyranids )

Cons:
- No Chaos customization in multiplayer, you can only changes their color not a single piece of armor
- Only 3 maps for multiplayer... truly a heresy
- 3 multiplayer modes aren't much better... Team Deatmatch, Capture point and Mobile Capture Point. Truly nothing special.
- For me game takes literally few minutes to quit... faster is just to press ALT+F4
- Though 6 PVE scenarios that we curently have are pretty good, on longer run they will lack replayability


- Campaign takes around ~10 hours to finish
- Multiplayer have 3 maps and 3 game modes
- There's 6 PVE scenarios each take around ~30 minutes

The sluggishness in the cinematic cutscenes can really dampen the intended effect of awe at the things you get to see in this game up close from the amazing 40k universe.

It’s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason that’s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

It’s had a successful launch, even from early access. Can be played offline, performs well and have barely come across any bugs. As a long time Warhammer fan…this game is everything I’ve ever wanted. Now we just need a Sororitas video game to match…

The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The new abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""

[1] Intro :

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.

[2] Game Experience :

The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)

A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.

Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.

(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

Legendz_Senpai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendz_Senpai/,"I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 € to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer. Many studios should perhaps take Saber Interactive as an example to take time to refine their game (isn't that right ubisoft) then just imagine a real single player game as refined as space marine 2 in the star wars universe. I 100% recommend the game",Recommended,1423,52.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

DirkDickbutt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DirkDickbutt/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, is an alien murder machine simulator developed by Saber Interactive and published by those guys that made their fortune making cycling simulators.

On the planet Kedaku, a Deathwatch Killteam is sent in to deploy a virus bomb to, at the very least, slow down the Tyranid hordes ravaging the planet. Demetrian Titus, former Ultramarine and current Ordos Xenos clean up crew member, is heavily injured after a battle with a Carnifex. He is saved, however, by his former Chapter, and Titus is reinstated as Lieutenant of the Ultramarine’s 2nd Company.
Also, his Killteam all died. They seemed nice.

Now, having undergone the Rubicon procedure, Titus is now one of those Space Marines that are taller than normal Space Marines, but their armor isn’t as cool so it always kind of feels wrong. He, along with squad members Chairon and Gadriel (not to be confused with that elf lady from The Lord of the Rings: Galadriel), Titus does battle with the Tyranid swarms as he and his men discover now and terrible secrets in a star system at war.

Some people waited thirteen years for this game, I was one of them. Space Marine II is practically a continuation of the first game with some new and cool features added on. No longer being restrained on the 360 and PS3, Space Marine II does a great job actually capturing the scale and numbers of a Tyranid invasion of a planet.

Space Marine II, like the first one, is a third person shooter revolving around shooting aliens in the face and then tearing them apart with whatever beating stick you have on hand. There are a variety of weapons to choose from such as, the Bolt rifle, the other Bolt Rifle, the longer bolt rifle, the bolt rifle but with a better scope, the one that shoots plasma, the melta gun that feels like you’re pushing your hand through a ball of wet socks when you use it. And also a bunch of melee weapons like: The knife the side of my entire body, a chainsword so I can stab you while I’m stabbing you, the power sword which is like a regular sword but also cuts thing gooder, and the big hammer you use because your message wasn’t clear enough when the chainsword was being used.

Its a neat mix of Gears of War shooting and hack and slash action. Dumping an entire magazine of bolt rounds into a swarm of Tyranids and then laying into them with whatever melee weapon you have on hand is the bread and butter of the game play, and its a pretty good bread and butter. Its like the first game where you turn grots and Orks into Swiss cheese, but now theres a ♥♥♥♥ ton more Tyranids than there were Orks in the first game, and slicing through them in swathes is basically dopamine injected straight into my brain.

There are also larger, angrier, hornier Tyranids that accompany the swarms. Warriors are the most common, but you do occasionally have to deal with other variants like the Lictor, a stealthy bastard, and the Carniex, a big bastard.
Zoanthropes are there too, but who cares.

Mission variety is mostly just trying to stem the tide of alien bugs, either by blowing them up good or deploying something that upsets them. But there’s some intrigue in the story, enough to keep you hooked with the plot, like a big reveal that I can’t mention.

Chaos is there, Tzeentch flavored this time. That’s not a spoiler, they’re in the promotional material. That’s not the big reveal, though.

Outside of the story mode, you also have two multiplayer modes to keep you coming back. Operations is a 3 player Co-Op mode where you and two of your Space Marine pals do stuff that helps Titus and the 2nd Company, as well as the Cadian 8th and any other Imperial butt hole in the system, deal with the invaders and send them packing. Its an interesting mode, almost reminds me of Left 4 Dead sometimes, its really fun to play, just make sure you have 2 other pals to play with or else an NPC follows you around and that’s lame.

The OTHER other mode is PVP, the Eternal War is an 8 vs 8 man murder mode where the Primaris Astartes do battle with the Heretic Astartes, the Chaos Space Marines, the LEGIONES TRAITORIS.
You have several classes to pick from, the same ones you pick in Operations, and then go to town on one another, either trying to kill 50 of them before they kill 50 of you or holding objectives until the timer runs out or the meter fills up.

Its a goofy, fun, chaotic time, but its also frustrating at points. It feels like kind of an after thought in a way. And the name of the game seems to be grouping up and melting the other guys via focused fire before they can melt you. You can do some clever things every now and then with your class abilities, but it mostly comes down to who sees who first and who pulls the trigger faster.

I like the game a lot, solid 8/10 for me, there’s just some things that irk me the wrong way. A lot of the weapons feel undertuned. I feel like when a weapon is basically “The one you start with, but bigger.” it should feel like it. I think a Tyranid Warrior, the ranged ones, once took 20 some rounds of bolter to the face before even being stunned.
The Boltguns in general also feel weak, I mean that in a game feel kind of way, not in a balance way, it does have problems balance wise, but. The way it sounds just sounds weak to me.

The Bolter in the first game was mean, it sounded like someone was punching the side of a car door really hard. The Bolt Rifle however may as well be making a “pew pew” sound.

Also, please put more attention into the PVP. I don’t know exactly how to fix it, maybe new maps and random spawns or fine tune the weapon a bit better? It feels like an afterthought since it was in the first game, which it might have been.

Yeah I like it a lot.

Space Marine II does a good job in capturing that fantasy of being a giant, 8ft tall meat mountain murder machine in a messed up super future. Your steps are big and stompy, and everything you hit with any kind of weapon just turns into a fountain of blood. Tyranids coming at you in the hundreds and literally climbing over one another like a tidal wave to get up a wall is amazing to see.

Warhammer 40,000 is such a weird franchise to me, mostly just because of where it stands as a series. Its a tabletop War game with a lot of extended universe material like books, comics, and y’know, video games.

Having been a Necron Player for the last 20 years or so, because I like winning and Terminator kicks ass, I got to see the war game I love fluctuate and change, introducing new people, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

40K is the only War Game I know where a good chunk of the fanbase actively refuses to play it. Even a lot of the other material is -mostly- ignored in favor of just reading summaries on wikis around the internet. Warpath and Mutant Chronicles probably don’t have this problem, and you probably don’t even know what those are.
And if you do, hey! We should play sometime.

Its a series that people want to change, mostly for the worse. Its also a series that people are way too invested in, and not even from a financial point of view. This endless war on the internet about what 40k should and shouldn’t be is, hilariously enough, sort of indicative of the franchise as a whole. An endless battle between people that don’t actually want a common ground, they just want to be in charge.

Its still very near and dear to my heart, but there’s probably going to come a time in the future where I might just have to move on. Mostly because of corporate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if my friends are all gone, I may as well go too.

Space Marine II: The Return of Titus Meat Man gets 8 Bolt rounds out of 10.

Pros:
+ melee is nice when it works like it should and in general you ""feel"" the weight of the hits
+ great, brutal animations and overally fighting is decent & fun
+ good gunplay; Normal (SP) & ""Minimal Threat"" feels EXACTLY how it should be balanced
+ CAMPAIGN IS BLOODY AWESOME, CHAD FUEL
+ big, awesome battles between guardsmen & tyranids
+ good, lore-accurate atmosphere
+ huge, beautiful landscape backdrops on maps
+ high production value: high graphics quality, even better sound quality
+ from small to GIGANTIC hordes. You can tell WWZ guys worked on this
+ rich & extensive armor customization
+ enemy AI is decent
+ unlike some other ekhu ekhu AAA games, you can kick people & turn off Crossplay
+ decent configuration & accessibility options
+ despite my system struggling with RAM availability lately, unless I've streamed via Discord the game ran FLAWLESSLY so far, despite hundreds of xenos on screen.
+ AAA game that doesn't suck or that isn't broken on release


- melee can be clunky & IMO not working properly at times and with enemy hits being as punishing as they are, well... that's a recipe for frustration, esp. on higher difficulties.
- ""Operations"" difficulty scaling feels bad. ""Mastercrafted"" weapons still feel like pea-shooters against medium-sized xenos on anything above ""Minimal Threat"" difficulty and thus if you're playing a ranged class, you might not have a good time. ""Recommended Class Level: 5""; we've had several 6+ classes approach ""Average Threat"" missions and we failed EVERY time.
- somehow my Titus was very unkeen to dodge-roll at the start of the campaign
- some boss fights aren't really fun nor designed well IMO
- armor customization menu is confusing
- bots aren't that helpful, the devs really should up their engagement
- can't play with 2 of the same classes in Coop; while it makes sense for some classes (Heavy), it doesn't make sense in case of Tactical or Assault Marines
- the game could use a bit more Coop conten; but Focus confirmed it's on the way.

These cons don't bring down how good the game is, nor most of it isn't hard to fix, IMO.
Space Marine's craft is death.
Focus Entertainment's craft is great WH40K games.

A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

76561198104361263,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104361263/,"I really like the game. I do wish the campaign offered more of a sense of progression and customization and rewards for completing missions in it other than just knowing you did so plus the accompanying achievement on whatever platform you might be playing the game. That aside, the first couple missions of the campaign I did were pretty fun and then I started doing Operations and never really felt a desire to go back to campaign.

In Operations, you get 6 different classes to play as and level up, with their own perks and 3 loadouts for each class to choose what weapons you want to bring into a mission. You'll be able to swap to any of those loadouts during various predetermined points in the mission and even if you don't want to change loadouts, you can at least use it to reload your ammo. Even if you fail an Operation, you get credit for each part of it you completed, and awarded some xp based on how far into it you got before you all died. If you win, obviously you get the normal amount awarded for completing that tier of difficulty and even more if you find a Gene Seed on the map during your run and whoever is carrying it doesn't die before the end of the Op. If you find a Gene Seed, be warned that you can't also carry a Guardian Relic-the item you can find on maps that can be used to revive yourself if you get downed. Scattered around the maps can be crates that can be smashed and often hold anything from ammo packs to med kits to the different types of grenades: shock, frag, krak (sticky), and melta bombs.

The xp you get for completing the Operation goes not just to your class of Space Marine, but your weapons used as well. Any class able to use the same weapons as another will benefit from that weapon xp and unlocks as well, meaning you can spend all your time with a chainsword on one class and switch to another at level 1, but still use the higher tier chainsword you unlocked with the higher level class. Once you level up a weapon, you get a Mastery Point to use to unlock a perk on the weapon. The more versions of that weapon you master, the more points you get to spend on perks that further upgrade any version of that weapon you use. Ranged weapons and melee weapons can each have at least 1 other version you can craft that works a little bit differently in combat once you unlock the 2nd tier of weapons. Melee weapons can often also have a different version that offers a block instead of a parry (at least judging by the description in game and how it's seemed to function so far). For example, I just got to the 3rd tier of weapons and made a force sword that hits nearly twice as hard as the one I was using before, but it's speed is at least 3 times slower according to the stats, and you can definitely feel it in combat. Even if it looks like there's only about a dozen or so different weapons in the game, you will be able to make a decent amount of different kinds that play quite differently from each other to keep the combat feeling fresh even beyond having 6 different classes and therefore 6 abilities to choose from.

I've mainly been playing the Bulwark class cause I liked the sword and shield combo it offered at first, but over time have really grown to love not only how powerful it's shield is (can block sniper fire-sure it staggers me, but i don't take any damage) but how good it's ability it. It can be upgraded to not only revive downed allies, but fully restore Contested Health of any allies within it's radius when used, plus deal damage over time to enemies within it's area of effect. Contested Health is HP you can recover if you deal damage within a short amount of time (or get a finisher) and it quickly fades over time, but again, the Bulwark can get a perk that slows that rate by 50%. There's currently no medic or dedicated healer class in the game, but the Bulwark is the next best thing for now and it's honestly not a bad substitute. My main gripe with it is there's a perk it can get that drops a shock grenade when it's armor pops, but that shock grenade also damages me when it drops. Not my allies-just me, it seems. I hope/assume it's a bug and not the intended design, because it can really get you into trouble at low health.

The Operations themselves are supposed to be unlocked alongside the main story as you play thru it, but I chose to just play my way thru the first 4 before I stopped and definitely not because I lost that one. Each one I played was not only pretty different from the others in terms of what was being done during the mission, but a decent 20-40 minutes in length depending on how things play out and how mean it wants to be to you. It can get pretty difficult at times, especially going from tier 2 to tier 3 in the levels of difficulty. I haven't tried the final tier/level of difficulty yet, but I can only imagine how much more difficult it gets. Just going to tier 2 ""average"" difficulty, there was a noticeable spike in how hard it was, plus how much less stuff there was and how much less the health kits restored-speaking of, you no longer dropped in with a free med kit from average difficulty on up. The higher difficulties are definitely more rewarding to play, though. Not just in terms of xp and extra coins, but how fun and brutally hard they can be and how satisfying it can be to survive waves and encounters in it.

The coins you get from completing Operations successfully and from playing pvp matches can be spent on unlocking new cosmetics for your Space Marines as well as new weapons for them to use to gain more mastery points for weapon perks. They're also used for unlocking perks on each of your 6 classes, so you'll probably be going thru a lot of them. Fortunately you can also get up to 75 coins per class if you complete each of their trials-they're little tutorials on how to better play as each class since each class plays so differently from each other.

I tried a couple matches of the pvp with a friend and while I thoroughly lost both of them-especially the first one-I had a lot of fun and want to play more of it. It feels kind of like third person Halo Reach multiplayer with more melee focused combat. You definitely have more of a chance to tank some shots than something like Call of Duty, but you and enemies aren't bullet sponges. It feels very fair in how they approached it as well. From what little I saw, it seems like you have your own progression system for pvp and you unlock more weapons to use in it. Even if you lose, you get xp based on what you do and if you do well, you're still rewarded for it. How do you ""do well"" things as simple as healing a teammate with the Bulwark's ability, assists, and of course kills, but also objectives, avenging allies-basically all the things that would get you those medals in Halo multiplayer would go towards giving you xp.

With only 6 Operations and 3 pvp modes, I was worried the game wouldn't have enough content to keep me interested for a while because I was expecting something more like their WWZ game where the main story missions basically were the main operations you did and then they had horde mode as another mode you could play-but I really think they structured things in such a way that it will offer a decent amount of replayability and keep enough people interested for long enough to feel like it was worth their money even if they decide to not finish the main campaign.

That said, I think starting things off with a forced campaign tutorial and then wanting you to play the first campaign mission before unlocking the first Operation was a bad decision. They should have dumped you straight onto the battle barge and let you at least do the first Operation and saved the whole forced tutorial and ""play a mission to unlock an Operation"" mechanic for after your first Operation rather than doing it the other way around. ---

The customization is around Primaris marines so sadly you don't have older truly classic helmets etc. I hope that maybe later some will make it into the game.

So far I played this game in advanced access and I had some crash and connection issues but hopefully, with GPU drivers and patches the issues will be gone at release or soon after.

Missions are intense at times and visceral, The final mission was the most cinematic moment I have seen in a game since Mass Effect 3 and I think this topped it. The PVE is fine for those who want to keep playing and grinding for gear. The PVE is a lot of fun as well. It was money well spent.

FaceRekt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FaceRekt/,"An excellent game with some performance issues on lower-end pc's (I'm still rocking a 1080Ti because GPUs are stupid expensive still).

Pros:
- This game *nails* the 40k aesthetic and environment better than any game before it - even Darktide.
- 3 game modes on launch. Even if Eternal War has some server issues, having more options on launch is good. Operations will get fleshed out further based on roadmap being posted by devs, so there'll be even more content to dig through later.
- Combat feels pretty good! The default control scheme on mouse and keyboard is a little whack, but you get used to it (or you can change it). Only thing is you *will* get animation trapped sometimes. It just happens.
- Visceral executions are a delight to watch

Cons:
- Story is fine I guess, any complaints I have are spoilers.
- Enemy variety is a little low.
- The AI for your two squadmates in solo-Campaign are *not* okay. They suck ass. Will frequently not target enemies, not execute stunned enemies, will not target enemies attacking objectives, sometimes won't even res you if you go down. Play with friends, or play on Easy (game doesn't have achievements for beating campaign on set difficulties, just for beating campaign at all) because playing on the hardest difficulty without friends has a few very acute pain points in the story. Otherwise, game isn't actually that hard.
- Eternal War (PvP) mode is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Time to kill is way too short, and there seems to be no rails on who you can get match-making into. So if you're a new guy into the PvP mode, you can get matched with people with all - and I mean *all* - the unlocked gear and get totally ♥♥♥♥ on until you catch up. Which can take a while, given you're getting ♥♥♥♥ on. This mode needs a rework, ASAP.
- The pay to get early access was scummy. Wish companies would stop this ♥♥♥♥.
- Performance issues; I've got an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080Ti. Game runs well enough but has some serious hangups once in a while even on Low settings. Possibly just lag from people joining/leaving sessions, but it's hard to tell if it's my hardware or the network. I'm overdue for an upgrade, so this might be an entirely *me* problem.
- Solo queueing into Operations is a similar annoyance in lack of team cohesion that solo-ing into LFD2 or *any* co-op PvE will bring you. People will run ahead, ignoring enemies, letting teammates die, just to try and run the level as fast as possible. Annoying as ♥♥♥♥, as it always is.

NPC Is 60-70% useful. They deal satisfying damage and contributed to battle. Shame we cannot command them to focus on a specific annoying target.

Some familiar elements from another game:
+Almost similar to Gears of War style, fight and vibe. Veteran players will enjoy something familiar. Too bad it doesnt have cover system.
+Souls-like element: parry combat allows you to engage in enemy one on one (also lock on).

So far in the game I find it lack in gameplay variety, all we do is engaging in direct combat and just shoot or melee. We need more variety like in Gears of War (riding tanks, or riding creature in GOW 1, riding vehicles, tank combat, vehicular combat, even in SM 1 we have ship-gunner combat) or Stealth-ish playstyle (like in GOW 1 avoiding Berserker, avoiding the bats at night, avoiding the dormant robots).

Kriev,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriev/,"Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperor’s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperium’s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

Skill based matchmaking is not a problem for multiplayer as it is not implemented. The PVE mode is fun and provides just enough challenge to be enjoyable several times over. The campaign is wonderfully done. It's very fun to customize your marine even if certain small traits (visor color, some more niiche colors like elbow braces) are not customization.

I would only really ask that the customization for chaos marines and the combat be tightened up just a bit more. It can be frustrating at times to be encouraged to do combos but you also cannot respond to counters/unblockable attacks being thrown in there.

tyrantoftheisles,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrantoftheisles/,"Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

TL:DR - if you have friends who are obsessed with Warhammer, this is a pretty decent game to play with them even if you have no interest in the setting. Puts Darktide to shame, but that's not exactly hard to do.",Recommended,2385,28.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

I really like this game it feels great to play and am happy a road map was already shown to address many issues. Though I have a few things I wish they would add and change.

Changes:
- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.

ashax,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashax/,"Campaign:
Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:
Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and needed more content.

It is early, but the balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources and sometimes placement of Ammo Crates, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood, World War Z, and maybe like playing Remnant 2 with a non-S/ A-Tier build but instead using a sub-optimal life-leech build.

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 1-6 sub-objectives to complete.

You have to ration your ammo in specific parts of certain missions and try to use the environment and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission).

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, with less resources spawning, and Medicae Stims healing less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy but effective.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects (Bulwark fully-healing after using Loadout change pods and their banner phasing through the lift in a mission).
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's Level 8 perk restores max contested health for squadmates in the AoE, allowing you to partially/ fully heal when combined with an enemy execution/ finisher, and the level 23 perk shares this with squadmates anywhere, which substantially reduces the need for healing items (and again, seems like a mandatory pick compared to the other options);
- Weapons with high damage per shot that can hit multiple enemies can heal past contested health (e.g. Melta Rifle, Las Fusil, etc).

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault). You also need to grind each class and weapons types.

Additionally, trying to get an Armory Data to unlock the next tier of weapons for the first time will be tougher than usual as you need to play the higher tier with previous tier weapons.",Recommended,2580,71.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is God Of War without character development and story
It is Gears Of War without the variety.
It is DarkTide with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

The Ugly
- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, you’ll need a gamepad, although it’s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case you’re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Can’t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guy’s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I don’t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. C’MON IT’S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacks… - cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they don’t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. It’s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your money’s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and that’s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

funkyfinzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/,"Basing this off of the singleplayer campaign, I'd give this game a neutral review if I could, I enjoyed some parts of it and some parts not so much. First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience.

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short.

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",Recommended,3009,17.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

The Dawn of War series was built around the already long-time established Warhammer 40k IP, but it came out SO GOOD that it appeared to be an even better embodiment of the setting than the ""original"" itself. And so, paradoxically, GW started to take insipration from DoW themselves, further developing the 40k setting as we know it today.

And I think that Space Marine 2 is yet another brilliant game like this. One that takes inspiration from the 40k's unique atmosphere, but nails it so well, that it will now determine the development of the IP for years to come.",Recommended,533,64.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

76561198130967517,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130967517/,"Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber. Hopefully a DLC will come out with more missions",Recommended,1359,38.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 7
WakaWaka221,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WakaWaka221/,"The latest 40k game that got tons of positive reviews before it was even released. It tells the story of how three and a half ultramarines defeated just a few million tyrranids and chaos followers. Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant “Why do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?” is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.
4)Royals in bushes the size of a necron tomb.

However, in general, game came out not bad and even much more lore-friendly than 3rd DoW

Последняя игрушка по 40к, получившая кучу положительных оценок ещё до выхода. Повествует о том, как три с половиной ультрамарина победили всего-то несколько миллионов тирранидов и хаоситов.

Тем не менее, бабло на игру, видимо, хватило, в отличии от первой части, благодаря чему:

Декораций в игре ровно опять три вида: руины в болотах, город, кладбище в руинах. Единственный проблеск света в самом конце: руины кладбища в варп-аномалии.
Врагов тоже три вида: тираниды, хаоситы, демон. Хотя для каждого типа прорисованы особые, пафосные анимации вышибания ереси.
Оружие по сравнению с настолкой переработано просто донельзя: из мелты сделали дробовик, из лазки снайперку, из штормболтера унылый пулемет, а из прыжкового ранца злобную машину неостановимой имбы. И не дали побаловаться тяжелым оружием

Игра преподносит генетически улучшенных воинов-сверхлюдей, как обычных мужиков-переростков в герметичных латах.
Практически всю игру, находясь в зоне боевых действий, главные герои ходят без шлемов (Строжайше запрещено Кодексом Астартес). Фраза капитана (!) Ультрамаринов (!!!), обращённая к сержанту «А чего ты так серьёзно относишься к Кодексу Астартес?» равносильна нарушению присяги каким-нибудь кридским полком.
Упомянутый капитан, воюющий с оружием, которого постыдился бы и обычный десантник, в доспехе менее пафосном чем у сержанта рядом.

slayerjustro666,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerjustro666/,"This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW!

FuscusNight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/,"It's pretty good, definitely not perfect but it's a well done sequel to the first game with some faults here and there.

Visuals
Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.




Just like in SM1's it's just 6v6 across 3 maps and 3 game modes, Annihilation (TDM), Seize Ground(Domination) and a KOTH-like mode with 6 classes . So it's light on the map variety but offers more variety than SM1 in terms of game play styles with more classes of which each one now has a unique ability to use, a frontal shield for the devastator heavy, a AoE chapter banner that heal's people armour from the Bulwark class or brief invisibility for the sniper and so forth.

So far have dug into it a fair bit, melee is a notibly weaker compared to SM1's PvP, this is potentially partially due to the lag problems of SM1's not offering extra protection for lag-teleporting assault marines who due to SM1's bad netcode would often just ignore half of the damage you threw at em'.
The game is also more team depended now, certain classes work together really well, the Bulwark is a shield guy with a power sword, his shield can absorb all ranged damage and surprisingly he can do it forever basically unless he gets hit from behind and then to boot he can deploy an AoE armor regen for everyone , so when you combine him with the heavy devastator class you got a combo that can deal with ranged and CQC targets very well , covering each others weaknesses and offering an armor heal from the bulwark and a frontal shield from the heavy devastator to keep each other in the fight.

It's not that bad at all , matter of fact i am oddly addicted to the PvP, there are some balancing quirks such as the Bulwark turtle players but nothing too extreme to ruin it fully.

However i do wish they did more with it, i wish it was 12v12 perhaps instead of 6v6, i wish the Chaos Marines could be properly customised, unlike loyalists the chaos boys just get preset colours and armor and that's it, the in-deph customization is completely lacking and missing for them.

Also levelling in it works in a way that you just get a higher number on your report card, you also unlock new weapons and winning X amount of matches gets you new armour cosmetics, which also can be earned in Co-Op mode. There are no perks, no means to change attachment or flat out upgrade your weapons in PvP, those things exist in co-op but are absent here and that's honestly for the better, it means there's no perks one can unlock to give unfair advantages over others as in SM1 and since gear is equal there's no max level guy who has a bolter that does 6x more damage than yours, those all exists still but are just for the co-op strike missions where you have light rpg elements in which you get to further fine tune,upgrade and buff up your class and weapons.




Think of it like doing Left 4 Dead campaigns that you just keep replaying for fun but also in this case to level up, earn new gear or get your current gear to become stronger, because it's not just your class that levels up and unlocks various perks and nodes you can purchase to upgrade your character but also your weapons get stronger too, unlocking stronger versions with even new cosmetics to boot to showcase that they are better.

You play as one of the two other squads in the game that under-take missions whilst TITUs and his team are doing their own thing. Though here the game does become gear n level depended, going to the hardest setting early on will just get you destroyed, since you're expected to play the lower difficulties first to get better gear and more upgrades for your class. It's an enjoyable chaotic romp, thought progress for gear can be a bit slow and higher difficulties above average tends to yield somewhat too spongy enemies even with high-end gear.",Recommended,4660,41.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
MassiveLinguini,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MassiveLinguini/,"The core game here is great. The enemy variety leaves a little to be desired, interface slightly clunky, and the side missions are (so far) inconsistent.

I am starting to hate the way they've tied health and armor systems into melee. Especially on higher difficulties it's just not feasible to regain health in certain fights.

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.

Oh and the ammo replenishment mechanics do not work in boss fights that physically yank your camera away to LOOK AT BIRD when your trying to replenish ammo.

Good 40k game, but there's a lot of jank getting in the way of a great overall experience.

La storia mi è piaciuta un sacco, le ultime due missioni sono testosterone in formato videoludico, le missioni coop post-storia sono molto carine, un Darktide un po' più ""semplice"", ed il pvp è divertente (ma da non prendere troppo seriamente).

Probably one of the best 40k Games made for years!
The combat is engaging, fun and hard!
Unlocking gear is enjoyable and you can skip some of the unlocs to get mastery points by using resources found in-game.
The game is beautiful to look at and the encounters are great!

We need more content for PvE but I'm thinking that will happen down the line, it seems like they will support the game going forward.

Only tried PvP for a short while, but it felt fine - melee goes straight through armour to health. It seems like no matter how much you've unlocked, you get paired with people.

76561198005529409,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005529409/,"Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",Recommended,2295,22.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

76561198032228335,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032228335/,"This is a rather difficult game to review as a non-Warhammer fan. Because from my perspective it is a competent hack-and-slash-shooter devoid of personable characters or any intriguing plot-elements. But to a Warhammer fan it is grimdark-personified; each human a cog in the Emperor's ever-marching war machine which renders every man and women as barren of life as the land itself.

Thus, this is less of a review of the story, and more so the game itself. Graphically, it looks rather stunning--with majestic vistas of the skull-regaled factories of the city worlds to the gruesome, steaming swamps of the backwater worlds. And while some people have reported issues of high-temps and crashes--issues that should be looked into and addressed--for the most part, and across a variety of systems, the game seems to run rather well. That shouldn't be a pro for any game, it should just be the standard. But it's 2024, so... bar's been pretty low for a while now.

The overall gameplay loop consists of running down un-inspired corridors to face random-sized groups of enemies. And while the campaign is mercifully and justifiably short, devoid of any diversity of gameplay or objectives, what you're then left with is the Operations Mode. Best described as a Raid Mode of sorts. You're expected to run through these over and over to level up your character(s) and your equipment to then run these maps on a higher difficulty. And therein shines both the game's main strength and its main flaw. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. And that motto does a lot to encapsulate the gameplay loop. There is only combat, and random objectives that rely on more combat. So it's a damn good thing then that the combat feels so damn good. Taking a chainsaw sword to a group of alien-baddies twice as short and thrice as frail as you will have you feeling like the Emperor's Chosen; pistols sound like a cannon and kick just as hard, and destroy just as much. Sniper Rifles are downright busted in the right hands. And I'll never, ever tire of grappling toward an enemy to deliver a skull-crushing dropkick. It speaks volumes that in a game with such limited enemy-variety and such non-existent diversity of gameplay I never got bored of the combat. It is fun, fluid and epic. It rewards aggression by granting you shields for each enemy killed through executions or perfect parries, and the ability to regen a bit of health lost to attacks if you're quick enough to retaliate. What isn't epic however is the un-inspired level-design, the lackluster repetition, and the horrid war of attrition that each mission eventually boils down to.
Each mission has a fixed layout and main objective, they don't change from match to match; instead, what does change is the placement of enemies, the number of them, and the amount required of each objective. Sometimes you'll be forced to place two bombs, another time you'll be forced to place five. And while this doesn't do a whole lot to shake the tedium of repetition, what it does do--however--is change the difficulty rather drastically. You can run into a couple of tiny one-shot guys one run, and a horde of huge, melee-focused guys another. And that would be fine if it wasn't for the limitations of their combat system. Because while it is fun, it is also rather limited in your ability to utilize it for your own survival. Like I said above, you can regen a bit of health lost if you're quick enough with a melee attack, and you can regain shields through executions or a shot to the head through the use of a perfect parry. What this does is promote an aggressive playstyle that rewards parries of the smaller enemies, and the executions of the larger ones. However, larger, melee-based elites don't give shields for perfect parries. And so, with the random spawns of enemies, you could find yourself surrounded by ten melee-based enemies and be unable to regain shields--meaning you'll watch your health dwindle and be unable to do anything about it. Worse, if you're then at the same time getting pummelled at range, which completely removes the ability to act quick enough that you regain a bit of lost health. Well, you can get better perks, of course. But that doesn't change that fact that random spikes in difficulty that skill cannot compensate for aren't fun; difficulty doesn't mean tediousness. And with a failed run meaning the potential loss of gathered upgrade materials, it being up to chance rather than skill is frustrating at best, and infuriating at worst. I'm not max level yet, and so maybe there are more perks to counteract such things, but it doesn't make the grind to get to max level any less annoying.

Class Progression is rather limited. You've no choice in what perk to begin with, meaning there's not really any build-variety. Weapon Progression offers a bit more variety, allowing you to choose whether you favour less speed and more damage, or vice versa.

Multiplayer is fine. It's a nice little relic of the early 2000s obsession with tacked-on versus modes. Little unbalanced, perhaps. But all the more nostalgic for it. It has a rather limited customisation-system. Grapple-hook dudes can use a Knife and a Sword but cannot use a power-fist. Shield-Bros can use a power-fist but cannot use a hammer, etc, etc. Fans might blame that on lore--but if that's the case, I don't really see why you'd offer customization at all. Better then to do perks, rather than equipment.

I do find it rather strange how unwelcoming the game is of newcomers. It doesn't go out of its way to ever explain any role, word or lore-based concept. And while one could argue that it is a game for fans, thinking that a Triple-A publisher would ever make a game of this size and not want to attract newcomers is downright naive. If you're not already a fan you'll either be real confused about a lot of what they're talking about, or you'll be spending half your playtime on the wiki. Overall it's a decent hack-and-slash-shooter that won't ever impress any non-Warhammer fan or person who enjoys a greater diversity of gameplay; it's all corridors and button-presses and horde-styled defence finales. But on the flip-side, it seems to be a delight for Warhammer fans; a crunchy, blood-soaked romp through a world of stainless steel and great, towering cathedrals, filled with horrid tech bonded with flesh, robot-skulls, and weapons galore, all of it in the Glorious name of the Emperor!",Recommended,5360,26.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Combat has weight and impact to it, the marines look good, the tyranids are relentless and the corridors and areas feel atmospheric. I mainly have small complaints like that bolters could have a little more punch to their sounds, blocking being a little confusing at the beginning and the menus being annoying to navigate with a controller as the cursor slows down A LOT on some UI elements but it sure does feel good to just have a game you can just play for fun without much modern nonsense in the way of just playing it. I'm also enjoying the photo mode.

I never expected a sequel to one of my guilty pleasure games but I'm so happy it exists! This game is such a huge improvement to the first one. The story was so fun and soooo sick. The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes.

If you enjoy working with friends to complete objectives and feel like a bad ass doing it, then this game is for you.

Now for some improvements they could implement down the line that would make the game an even better experience. There needs to be an option to run operations solo which I believe is coming in the form of private PVE lobbies. More importantly there needs to be a way to command your AI partners even if it's only to be able to have them target a specific target cause there is nothing more frustrating than trying to deal with a Zoanthrope flying in the air with your bolt pistol cause you took a melee class. Or if you are against that then give the melee classes the ability to perhaps grab the zoanthrope from the air and bring it to the ground to then smash with their melee weapons.

From the Desk of Brother-Sergeant Gabriel, 3rd Company, Ultramarines Chapter

Mission Log: 15 Hours In, Campaign Complete

Hail, Brothers and Sisters of the Imperium,

The long-awaited call to arms has been answered. Space Marines 2 has descended upon us like a righteous storm, and after dedicating a solid 15 hours to its campaign and accessories, it is time to deliver our verdict.

Space Marines 2 has risen to meet the high expectations set by its predecessor and then some. The narrative, steeped in the grimdark lore of the 40K universe, unfolds with the gravitas expected of our sacred battlefields. Each mission is a crucible of intensity, keeping the Emperor’s light blazing as you face the myriad horrors that plague the galaxy. The campaign's storyline is robust, providing a compelling blend of heroism and tragedy that befits the grand saga of the Space Marines.

Combat is a symphony of visceral destruction, every engagement a testament to the might of the Adeptus Astartes. The bolter’s roar and the chain sword's hum are rendered with such fidelity that it feels as though you’re wielding these sacred relics yourself. The enemies are varied and formidable, challenging even the most seasoned warriors among us. The improved AI ensures that no battle is ever truly predictable, demanding tactical acumen and reflexes as sharp as a power sword.

Graphically, the game captures the dark majesty of the 40K universe with hauntingly beautiful environments and detailed character models. The ambiance is as oppressive as a Space Hulk, with every setting dripping in the atmosphere of an Imperium on the brink.

In terms of gameplay, the enhancements to combat mechanics and the new abilities granted to our esteemed warriors are noteworthy. The balance between raw power and strategic depth has been finely tuned, allowing us to crush the xenos and heretics with righteous fury.

However, the path of the righteous is not without its trials. There are moments when the mission design feels somewhat formulaic, and a few technical hiccups mar the otherwise flawless execution of this grand endeavor. Yet, these are but minor blemishes on an otherwise gleaming armor of excellence.

In conclusion, Space Marines 2 stands as a proud addition to the legacy of the Warhammer 40K series. It honors our tradition of battle while forging a new path with unwavering zeal. For those who walk the line of the Emperor’s light, this is a battle worth engaging in.

As an enjoyer of 40k its nice to be eating good again.

This is a masterpiece, I haven't played a game that has made me this happy in a long time. The gameplay, the lore, the graphics, all of it sings of love and care. This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.",Recommended,1381,34.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 10
sarge9272,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sarge9272/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is nothing short of a triumph, seamlessly merging intense combat with a gripping narrative in a way that will captivate both long-time fans and newcomers alike. This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals. Saber Interactive really came through with this installment. It is a game that long time fans of Warhammer 40k truly have been asking for.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking paired with a bombastic audio design, Space Marine 2 showcases the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has a offering of diverse modes and a progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive. Looking forward to see what Saber Interactive does with future content.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world. It’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a standout entry for those new to the universe. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving itself as a benchmark in the genre.

76561198019816127,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019816127/,"Space Marine 2 is a long-awaited, much-hoped-for sequel to the first Space Marine game. You play as <REDACTED> (jk it's freaking Titus like that wasn't obvious enough) who starts off using Primaris-styled equipment as a regular first-born marine. Hmm. Can't say that's particularly lore accurate, but whatever, it's Titus so that's cool. Unfortunately he's no Mark Strong this time, can't blame him after everything that happened. Be aware.

I tried playing the campaign missions on Angel of Death difficulty. This will color my breakdown below.

The 'nids are, as expected, annoying ass space bugs that swarm you faster than skaven do at a Warpstone rave party, and they're fairly dangerous. In fact, each of them individually might not seem like a problem but start throwing in 3 or so hormagaunts and you'll start having more stab wounds than a mugging victim in London. The termagaunts, those little annoying freaking shooty bugs, appear to not wield regular fleshborers, since the damn things flash green like miniature rapid-fire venom cannons. If you don't know what a venom cannon is, I'll explain it further down below in the Warrior section.

All of these swarm mechanics overwhelming you through sheer numbers is really pronounced. I started having to take engagements carefully and seriously right from the get-go. You can't regenerate any health from simple executions this time either, you need to have taken damage recently (a la Bloodborne) and this makes Titus not only feel like tissue paper, but unable to recover easily. You need to use the medical stims and those are far and few in between, so they definitely took the 'its too easy' critique about the first game too much to heart. Titus will find these enemies dangerous and annoying in equal measure as a result, so don't go thinking you can charge into the jaws of hell and not get tarpitted harder than Abbadon facing a 50 block of guardsmen backed up by a Commissar Lord. They are just as fearless as said guardsmen and unlike Abbadon, Titus can't ♥♥♥♥ out like 10 attacks in a single round of combat, so you better hope you're good at parrying.

Note that while parrying or dodging or attacking, you are more or less animation locked. You can't cancel easily, and this honestly makes you feel a lot more sluggish than Captain Titus, who is now obviously the best version of Titus there was. This means you have to thin their numbers at range, hopefully reducing the 'gaunt variants down to less than 3 by the time the Warrior rushes you down.

Let's talk about Warriors. Warriors are the big 'nids that have that annoying ass whip, that annoying ass paired boneswords, that really annoying ass devourer, or that annoying ass venom cannon (that long snout thing).
The Whip is not too bad in a 1 on 1, just make sure to either stay clear of it while wiping out the small forms or...dunno, charge in and beat it to death before it can get really annoying. When it does that lash combo attack, it's very hard to parry so you're better off just trying to keep your distance and shooting it down.
The twin boneswords is just tanky. That's it.
The devourer is basically a rapid-fire fleshborer, and the Warrior who uses it is the most irritating PoS you will ever encounter. It will constantly skate away to the backline to pepper you with clusters of projectiles and it adds up a lot of damage very fast. Snipe this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as possible. If you try to close in melee, it will sometimes unload every shot into you at point-blank range and you can die from this.
The last one, the venom cannon wielder, is the sniper variant. A venom cannon is like a biological railgun except instead of shooting a metal projectile it shoots this venomous acidic crystal that is superheated by the electrical discharge (yes, this is how it works in lore) and is launched at high speed to penetrate vehicles...or something. It didn't really work against real vehicles, but it definitely works against MEQ (shorthand for 'marine equivalent') like Titus. You will get a warning in the form of a sickly green laser tracking you and you can dodge the shot quite easily with good timing. The real problem is when one of them shows up and you are fighting a swarm or two and their Warrior melee cousins all at the same time, which is when things get nasty. Even then, its particular attacks are not hard to avoid, so either trust in your mobility or kill them off first, your choice.

There's more bug variants and their stupid tactics but I'm tired of talking about bugs so let's talk about weapons.

Gunplay and melee aren't mutually exclusive, it retains the general fluidity of the first game and you can swap between the two styles of combat very fast. Pistols are actually useful, they take their own slot and can help offset some disadvantages of your primary, while also serving as a way to perform kill shots on parried enemies.

Bolters. Holy Emperor the bolters. There are so many bolter variants, and some of them being very cross purposes with their actual function to the point it makes you wonder who needs this many variants. They are all lifted from the Primaris arsenal, and you get the whole freaking line of them (except Assault Bolters). Bolt carbines, heavy bolt pistols, auto bolt rifles, you name it they have it. In fact, I would argue that there are simply too many bolters. In the first game most of the same roles were replicated by unique weapons, such as the plasma gun, the lascannon, the vengeance launcher, and so on. Now you get...bolters.

Some of them are effective and some are not, but all of them are only average on Angel of Death difficulty so I didn't really find them to be that unique. What stood out were the non-bolter weapons, the Plasma Incinerator and the Melta Rifle.
The Plasma Incinerator is like a cross between the regular plasma gun and a very small plasma cannon, and it performs well enough in that role. It's plasma and it hurts.
The Melta Rifle is basically just like the melta gun from the first game. Tight AOE cone that does more damage the closer to the center of the aiming circle you get, huge shotgun blast that can melt anything.
There's some other stuff like the Las Fusil, which is basically just a lascannon if they scaled it down and in-game it's basically a Charge Rifle from Titanfall. It's still a good weapon, but they clearly learned their lesson from the first game where the lascannon's instant shot could utterly destroy an unfortunate enemy's face at close range.

Melee weapons unfortunately all feel a little samey. The chainsword is effective but it only swings in tight arcs and relies on a charge attack combo to stun enemies, which is extremely awkward compared to the first game where your stun/charge attack was another key altogether. This means it is very easy to start a chainsword combo then get hit for your trouble because you have no way of interrupting your enemy.
The power sword is a little more forgiving as it has actual stances that emphasize AOE or single target combat. It still has the issue of not being able to stagger big creatures reliably, or having a charge attack combo that matters, but it is reliable enough with its large sweeping attacks to actually outperform the chainsword on a regular basis.
The thunder hammer took a big hit from last game. It is just as sluggish and slow despite Titus' better augmentations, but is weaker. You can put a lot of hurt on enemies, but you have too many gaps open that leave you unable to defend yourself properly. Compare that to the first game, where the hammer's instant-kill damage and reliable stun combo can AOE wipe out hordes of daemons or whatever. It's very weak in this game.
The power fist staggers most enemies. Good enough.

76561197988739387,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988739387/,"I have been hoping for a sequel for space marine for 11 years, I have been waiting for this to release for 2 years. Does it deliver? I will explain below, starting with the campaign, then the MP modes ending on the technical details and overall thoughts.

Campaign


Space Marine 2 puts you into the armour of a Space Marine 40.000 years into the future. A genetically engineered super soldier that is 3 metres tall, a space marine is almost indestructible, they are faster and stronger than any normal human and some of them can be hundreds of years old. They are wrapped in myth and legend and are skilled warriors beyond measure. They are a bulwark against terror in a universe that has known only war for centuries.

Humanity is fighting against horrors beyond their comprehension and while there are several factions of said horrors, the main one we're dealing with here, is a Tyranid Hive fleet.
Tyranids are a bug/lizard like faction that swarm the universe to consume biomass, they evolve at an incredibly fast rate and can counter almost any known weapon or biological agent known to mankind and speed is of the essence when dealing with them. A planet attacked by them never truly recovers and there are millions and millions gunning for you.

The story picks up quite some time after Space Marine 1, and you are Titus. While I won't go into much story detail. The tutorial and thus the introduction to Space Marine 2, immediately shows what stakes you're up against and sets the tone for the entire campaign.

The campaign is a great introduction to some of the scale that Warhammer 40K offers and its bleak hopeless setting, there is only war and it shows. The campaign is filled with gigantic set pieces, wild lush alien forests and jungles, gigantic cities with massive cathedrals or abandoned bunkers and dark secrets. Everywhere you see signs of the carnage that happens all around you and the grimdark setting that 40K invented really shines here.

Gameplay wise the game is reminiscent of Space Marine 1, just improved upon. combat is fast and diverse and the game expects you to switch tactics on the fly.

As a space marine you have a great arsenal of weapons to use, from the infamous Bolt weapons, massive assault weapons that fire a bolt, a massive rocket propelled round that embeds itself in the target and detonates, to melta guns, plasma guns, heavy bolters. But you also have several melee weapons, from the Chainsword, to the Thunderhammer. Why? because the combat in this games switches between thinning out hordes and hordes of enemies before they reach you and then turns into a hack and slash brawler fest.

The combat is incredibly dynamic and it keeps you on your toes especially on higher difficulties. Luckily you are not alone in this rigorous slaughter fest. Titus has two other space marines with him, which can either be controlled by your friends or the computer. While the bots lack some finesse and tend to focus on direct threats, they are a welcome addition. Just don't expect too much of them, they are bots. they beeline for you to get you up if you're down but not out and they can distract some enemies.

The campaign will take you around 10 to 12 hours to complete and my time with it was enjoyed very much, I had several ""Holy sh!t"" moments and I felt like a space marine, the story is all I hoped for after 13 years and I loved it.


The multiplayer is the other part of Space Marine 2. It can be separated in two parts: PVE and PVP.


PVE is one of the parts that shines here, during the campaign several squads often help Titus with secondary objectives, the PVE or Operations gives you control of these squads. You can run this with up to two of your friends or bots, but trust me, play with friends.

You have six classes with each of them having a distinct role, weapon set and main ability.
From the standard space marine with bolter and chainsword, to the bulwark with shield and sword to a stealthy sniper

Each class has weapon upgrades, perks for the weapons and the class itself and customisation to unlock.
Yes you can create your very own space marine or unlock several other space marine chapters and customise those and while the customisation needs some polish, it's incredibly varied.

There are currently six operations most of which coincide with the campaign, they can take 30 to 45 minutes to complete and on higher difficulties they require coordination, tactics and sharing of resources.

They often feel like mini raids and they are incredibly fun to do, however in contrast to games such as Darktide I wonder how fun these missions stay, they feel less like a horde shooter and more like a mini campaign, while enemy variety and objectives can switch around in an operation, I feel it might get repetitive. Yet they are like I said incredibly fun and I will probably keep coming back to them, just because of the gameplay loop.


The second MP mode is Eternal War, a 6v6 PVP mode with the same classes as the Operations mode, just different progression. There three modes, King of the Hill, Seize ground (several points to capture) and Annihilation (team death match) and as of writing 3 maps.

The gameplay in pvp is great, classes are diverse and while some balancing might be happening it is incredibly fun to play despite it's lack of maps and modes. I spend several hours playing this and the tactical aspect in it is really fun, it isn't just run and gun, you have to counter other classes, bullwarks can block damage, snipers sneak around, assault's jump in to cut you down. There are tons of cool skirmishes to be found and it's an absolute blast.

However it's also the most bare bones part of the game. While the customisation for space marines is great, the chaos marines lack customisation, every class is attached to a traitor legion and is thus bound to it. You cannot play an iron warrior vanguard for instance and the armor itself is barely customisable, sometimes even not. For some of the more chaos minded players this can be quite a big letdown.

The other issue is that while it is 6v6 I can only make a lobby with three people, not six or four, locking out some of my friends to play with, I get it for PVE, I don't for PVP.

PVP feels like something added later in development and I hope that the devs do expand upon it with some much needed Quality of Life changes.


The game is quite CPU heavy, I have a i9-10850k CPU and a RTX4070 TI SUPER, the game runs like a charm in 90% of the game, but some areas and missions are incredible heavy on the CPU so much I wonder if it's a bit of optimalisation. Some area's that are small tank my frames, while some large open areas I run at a solid 80 FPS on ultra settings.

Besides that though, the game is beautiful to look at and effects, lighting, textures are all incredibly impressive, from the sparks of a broken cable to the blood that flies around.

The sound design is really well done and weapon sounds pack the punch you expect them to, every bolt fired, every enemy screech, every punch thrown is of high quality and this combined with the graphical design makes this a very immersive 40K game.


Despite some personal gripes and an in my opinion a bare bones PVP, this game has been worth the wait, it build upon the foundation of Space Marine 1 and improved it immensely. It offers something for older fans and something for newer fans of 40K and it is an incredible home-coming or introduction to the Space Marine franchise and thus Warhammer 40.000. It's an incredibly brutal, fun third person action game and the gameplay loop is quite addicting.

Sabre shows it understands 40K and this game is an ode to it.

CoalFire,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoalFire/,"Campaign: one of the best I've played in recent memory - this is the only part I can recommend
PvE: repetitive and loses steam after about 3 runs of each map
PvP: not my jam, no opinion, have not played

Overall the combat and general gameplay is some of the most satisfying I've seen since something like Gears but without all the cover nonsense and the first run of the campaign has some real jaw dropping moments in both visuals and reveals.

However, if you're looking for more than the campaign, this is hard to recommend. Much like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, World War Z, Darktide, etc, there's just nothing to do in the PvE Operations mode except grind out cosmetics and passives. That might be enough for some, but it lacks any of the systems that make something like Destiny, Warframe, Deep Rock Galactic, Remnant, or the plethora of other rougelikes out there that do so much with mapgen and other secondary systems that make each run feel like a run, not just going through the same motions again. I'm never excited by anything that's gonna drop from a mission, it's just ""cross the finish line this many times"" for your next passive/cosmetic.

Cosmetics are awesome, classes are fine, progression kinda sucks since you only unlock one row at a time. Not sure I'll be playing long enough to max a single class despite only playing two of them. Passives are... there? They all feel like relatively minor gameplay bonuses that help steer your playstyle, but not one so far has made me excited to unlock or feel it was worth working towards. They feel more like bypasses to some inconvenince rather than some Astartes-level power. I don't think I'd be able to tell an endgame level build from an early game one from gameplay alone.

Would be awesome if in new game + you could play the campaign with your custom marine so 60% of the PvE missions were playable with the PvE classes. I think that's my biggest issue, the best PvE content isn't what you get to replay for progression and what's there to replay gets stale fast. Really hope to see some updates to the operations modes that make them more fun to replay. Modifiers, loot drops that persist after a play session, consumable buffs, unique mission rewards, map variants, mapgen, really anything except playing the same mission over and over with some different combat pacing each time.

Every single gameplay aspect has something holding it back:

- Melee (not enough stagger/damage on higher difficulties especially annoying with the hammer),
- Shooting (barely any gun feels powerful and most of them sound weak too, it's just a feeling though damage is ok)
- Executions/Finishers and other animations where you cant control your character do not have enough invulnerability frames so you take lots of damage without any means to avoid it.

In the end it doesn't matter cause you still feel like a Space Marine and some of the missions are breathtakingly beautiful, just not the second coming of Christ that most of people are telling me this game is.

Uh...well...
There's Space marines
Loading screens
And buggy cutscenes...

Oh and chainswords....
Mother
F*cking
C H A I N S W O R D S !

In all seriousness yeah its an alright enough game with a short but decent campaign (albeit some aforementioned cutscene errors or bugs such as where they either freeze but the audio continues or its the opposite of the audio lagging behind the visuals of a cutscene).

Combats fun allowing you to pull off some cool as finishers to enemies to regain health and shields (finishing moves in action games is always a win) but some of the controls can feel quite janky with awkward keybinds set by the game for pc.

The operations co-op mode currently has an error where you can get stuck in the hub after readying up for a level and would certainly benefit from some variety, otherwise the same 6 levels could get repetitive for some people, I like to think of it like its Left 4 Dead where you can play through the same levels countless times but the game play is what keeps it fun, but some more random/less linear objectives if possible could probably help make the levels feel less repetitive.
With hopefully some more content and additions operations mode can hopefully reach just a bit more of the potential that it does offer, but still simply just co-op romping with some friends or random allies and curb stomping aliens together are fun solid foundations, hopefully it can just be improved upon.

There's a PVP multiplayer mode where you play as the space marines faction or the Chaos marine (evil hellish marines) faction and fight each other. I haven't played much of it myself but yeah its alright, its there for those who want it.
You can't unfortunately customise the Chaos faction characters, you get premade models for each of the classes on that side, which while they do look cool themselves, does seam like some people are still let down that you can't customise them as well like you can with the space marines.
As far as I've seen theres not many like cool takedowns or anything you can do to enemy players, its just clunky space marines on both sides blasting or thwacking each other clumsily like its a call of duty game and using their ultimate abilities non-stop with no cohesion to see who dies first, then respawning with your abilities charged again to rush back into the fight and repeat the process. Yeah its alright for those who may like the PVP stuff but personally I think the PVE stuff's more the games strong point.

Both the Co-op mode and PVP mode have separate level progressions though so don't think you can level up a class in co-op mode then pop into PVP with a skilled up PVE dude and stomp fools, which is fair BUT however, while class level progression is separate for each mode. You can still unlock cosmetics currency and armour pieces for your characters just by completing matches in both modes as each character. So you can still play both modes and they still count for cosmetic progress at least for each class you beat a match as, so thats nice.

Yeah look, TLDR: Its a decent co-op game and being able to run around and stomp out enemies with allies while playing as giant f*ck off power armoured boys is still awesome. Heck I'm not a big Warhammer series fan myself meaning I knew bugger all about the lore, but I am starting to learn some things about the universe by playing this game and its encouraged me to look a bit more into it.

And you don't need to be a fan of the franchise or know everything to enjoy the game, I'm a simple fella, I saw big mech suits, chainsaws and brutally ripping alien scum to shreads... and thats all I wanted from it.

So its still a solid cool game to play and have fun wreaking havoc on enemies with your big space marine ruthlessness and brutality. But I think it would benefit from some more additions and content, the foundation is there, just build on it and add more levels, and maybe some variety in objectives to keep the co-op mode from becoming stale.

P.S The Season Pass content cosmetics have been a bit disappointing so far, Its just more colours and decals really, I was hoping for more unique/cool and actual standout armour pieces or such to justify its content but so far it leaves alot to be desired IMO.",Recommended,3554,69.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
Revendawn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Revendawn/,"My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

The re-playable/grind-able missions I feel will get a bit boring after maybe 20-30 hours of grinding them. There is some variation in spawns (elites/bosses can spawn in certain parts of the mission path) but with the few missions that you can run, it isn't enough. Granted the devs plan to expand this later.

There is a PVP mode that will extend the games life a bit but I am yet to try it, although I think it is probably gonna be quite fun.

The game looks beautiful and runs smooth for me (7950x3d, 4090FE, 64gb 6000mhz ram) with the only issue being - when I try to quit the game, it doesn't actually quit. I have to kill it manually.

Overall, id recommend this but if you are only here for the story - wait for it to be expanded with DLC releases or wait for the game to go on a 50% sale. I also got the ultra edition - don't do this unless you just want to support the game, the content it gives you over the Gold isn't really worth it.",Recommended,1129,68.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 7
76561198000162778,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000162778/,"Fantastic. It’s exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to 2011’s Space Marine and a Warhammer 40K action game. It takes everything that made the first game fun and cranks it up, refining pretty much everything that you remember about that original game.

I never followed the details about the story prior to the release so I wasn't sure if it's gonna pick up from where the last game left off. But I was pleased to see that not only does it still feature Captain Titus as the main character, but also manages to be an overall much better story with a couple of fun memberberries thrown in for fans of the original.

And if you're really invested in the lore, you'll be pleased to know that the developers poured a lot of heart and attention into making this an accurate 40K experience. It's probably the most authentic ""play as a Space Marine"" experience to date, because you truly feel like an eight-foot-tall truck on legs, towering over regular humans and barreling through everything like an elephant in a china shop. Including any living thing that isn't at least as big, because it's going to end up getting stomped like a grape. Everything about this game's design is just as over-the-top, excessive, and ludicrous as you'd expect, and it's glorious.

After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off.

Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning.

Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun.

Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen.

As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally.

Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now.

I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.

Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :)

With Space Marine II, Saber interactive proves, once again, that they know how to do action games, this time adding a ton of Co-op & PvP options powered by their squeaky-clean net code. The game runs excellently, looking great and performing to specification. I was able to stream it from the same rig I was playing on, and only got one random crash during my five-hour session. Visuals are great, audio is fantastic, and the writing found here is far better than any game in the genre usually gets. The Swarm Engine that made WWZ what it is comes into play and provides a breathtaking sense of scale to most encounters. The price-tag might be a bit steep, at least when we are talking about the Early Access Versions, but they come packed with the first Season Pass, which will eventually make the investment worth it.

Swarm AI is impressive, combat system additions are very welcome, character customization is tied heavily into the lore, etc. Only downside I see so far at launch is that ultrawide support is missing, but they've already confirmed that is going to be added by the end of the month. Just like SM1, what will really matter for this game's longevity is how well they support it post-launch with content.

Edit after 4 hours:
Edit after 10.5 hours:
1) Maybe I'm misremembering Space Marine 1, but the PVP seems like a very big downgrade from the fun factor of the original -- simply because the time-to-kill is absurdly low. Like lower than the latest COD game. Fights are typically over before they begin. Even Eternal Crusade felt much more fun and dynamic to me. I hope my impression improves with more time into it.

I take back my negative first impression about PVP after putting 4 more hours into it. I am really loving it now that I got into the groove of it. The game heavily rewards teamwork, synergy between classes/class abilities, flanking, and also (when directly confronting the enemy team) tactically weaving and and out of fights to stay alive and alongside your teammates. I just hope they add more maps, but overall the gameplay, classes, etc. are all very well done.

2)

Matchmaking problems has already been largely solved, so it seems similar to the Helldivers 2 launch where there was a rocky few days and then it was fine. This may happen again when the official release date happens, but I'm expecting to be solved quickly again.

3) Pistol executions seem broken because the camera completely blocks your view every time.

4)

Singleplayer is great, but coop is even better. Also I had no idea Operations mode was an RPG type mode with unlockable skills. Very pleasantly unexpected surprise.

5) I'm bummed about lack of ultrawide support at launch, but I knew that going in from the roadmap. Thankfully they are adding it this month.

ThatGuyCronin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatGuyCronin/,"Short Version:
Visually beautiful game, fun gameplay, good amount of variety in classes, few bugs, lots of re-playability, Co-Op PvP and PvE, beloved lore and well loved franchise.


Long Version:

Space Marines 2 is a sci-fi and gothic dark fantasy with biblical motifs that make Warhammer 40k awesome. The sheer and immense sense of scale, both indoors and outdoors perfectly capture the depth of the world that is Warhammer.

You can feel the immense love for the lore and source material, it's definitely made by fans who genuinely care about this world that is imbued through the visuals and attention to detail in every facet and asset.

This is every Warhammer 40k fan's wet dream.


Pros:
• Impressive visuals with lore-accurate art direction. The brutality and bleakness of the 40K universe are masterfully conveyed
• Superb combat system that equally rewards skill, resource conservation and a tactical, team-oriented approach. Very easy to pick up and get better. Pacing is done very well
• Solid variety of enemies, all of which have unique behaviors, movesets and abilities
• Bosses that evolve their movesets dynamically, and are highly challenging on the harder settings
• The 40K lore is accurately transposed and faithful to the series canon
• Enjoyable, well-written storyline, compounded by plausible characters and interesting events
• Exploration and Customization are rewarded
• DLC's are purely cosmetic, all future content is already planned ahead of time and content is free


Cons:
• AI companions aren’t smart enough for complex objectives, and can’t be ordered around or customized
• Balancing issues make some weapons redundant or useless
• Tabbing out of the game at any point causes the game to freeze, and I'm rocking a pretty solid set up



Writing/Lore/Worldbuilding

“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; Humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it un-enjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty the game has to offer. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.


Exploration & Secrets

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.


Operations (PVE) and Endless War (PVP)

After the Campaign, you’ll unlock several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.


Content & Replay Value

Average playtime is around 16 hours to complete the game on Angel of Death (hardest) difficulty with two AI teammates, taking extra time to explore all locations thoroughly. After that, Operations and PvP modes greatly extend the content with their high replay value. The story is instead linear, and there’s no reason to replay it except achievements.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch and CTF to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.



Conclusion:

Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Even if you’re not a 40K fan and just enjoy action games, this is a solid pick. Even better if you have two friends to tag along; the best experience is in co-op.

One of the best WH40K games ever made. Not only it surpasses its predecessor on all fronts, but also sets a point of reference for modern co-op-focused action titles.",Recommended,5099,46.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

Amazing looking game, good controls, but somewhat badly optimized, it's better than some AAA titles nowadays, as in I've only had 1 or 2 stutters at the start of the game, but the FPS I'm getting is very low even with DLSS on the Medium Preset.

itscampi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itscampi/,"the game, story, visuals, are very, very good, however one think to keep in mind is that I dont think combat will click with everyone

this is not Helldivers 2, this is not remnant 2 in terms on combat
and unlike HD2 there's not much replayability

I finished the campaign in the veteran difficulty which is the third out 4, which would normally make it the hard one, but in this case is the one devs intented you to play as stated on the difficulty slider

You will feel very weak at the beginning of the game while you accommodate to the mechanics, any enemy can kill you in this game, they all do a lot of damage (specially ranged ones), and you will NEED to learn how to parry, dodge, use melee combos and know where and what weapons are the most effective

If you pass through that learning curve at the start, you will enjoy the rest of the game, keep in mind that in operations (the pve mode) you will have different classes to use and get more enjoyment out of the combat, shame the weapon selection in the campaign

great game overall 8/10",Recommended,858,30.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

EVERYTHING about it is brilliantly done, when saber promised their love and devotion to the 40k universe, i swear to you they have delivered. you feel every second, you feel every moment, this is the edge of your seat action game ive been needing.

if you are passing on it, ignoring it thanks to foolish small negative spam of the reviews. you will horribly miss out on the experience of the year, we have had so little this past year that brings a great experience. saber delivered the golden child. this games experience is nothing like anything else. you wont regret it. and this is after finishing the tutorial and just the first major mission. with more in store. its worth every single penny.

Now let me say, there ARE some server instability issues, however this is a pretty normal launch day issue. saber is addressing all the current issues with incoming patches, they have said this in some recent posting.


after almost 8 hours edit:
i solved my discconnect issues after i verfied and applied an os update. since then no issue.

i may be nearing the end of the campaign and i could not say how much i still stick to my word here. they have stayed true to form, every minute has been engaging. and i havent even touched upon operations yet. perhaps my one complaint is combat couldve felt a little more weighty? though its not something ive felt that much of an issue.

i have been thoroughly enjoying the ride. i had to make myself stop because i needed a break. the latest mission i was on was going for over an hour. phew...

i will probably finish the campaign the next day, tonight im going to join my playgroup so they can play the campaign some.

Campaign completed edit:

what a ride, i honestly doubted at first if they could write a competent story, but the whole time i was going through it i was engaged. and this was going through the campaign entirely solo. when i assisted my playgroup in doign the campaign i was still engaged for those banger moments and i have to say i made their experience move along much smoother.

yes the bot ai is kinda rough, but this is pre release. theres always some things to fix up or touch up when a game goes live. but they arent a complete hindrance. the enemy ai needs some tweaking as well.

overall though after i touched on operations mode this game is hands down going to be a favorite. theres lots to unlock, and lots to do still. an interesting part is the squads you see that you deal with through the campaign are what you do in the operations. excellent tie ins i have to say. players are seemingly chill too, always pointing out armor or meds etc.",Recommended,2272,54.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

From personal experience, do not start the game on Veteran difficulty even though game suggests it is the intended experience. My first hour was pretty frustrating as i kept dying repeatedly, feeling way too squishy for a Space Marine,
After I switched to Normal difficulty, game shined and Campaign was a hell of a ride.
It is certainly ""Skill issue"" and i now feel ready to try higher difficulties, but i would still recommend Normal to start with.

On technical side, missing ultrawide support and FOV slider bugged me at first, but did not impact my enjoyment overall (ultrawide support is promised in upcoming patch).

V-O-V,https://steamcommunity.com/id/V-O-V/,"Now that I have finished the Campaign fully I feel I can give a fair review.

But for those who TLDR: The Positives of Space Marine 2 massively outweigh the negatives. It is the sequel that Space Marine deserved and more.

Pros:
- The large set pieces and open battlefields are fantastic, you truly feel as if you are in an unwinable battle against overwhelming odds.
- The actual fighting gameplay is great. You feel heavy and powerful as a Space Marine should
- Story is overall very good, fair amount of fanservice especially as you get towards the late game.
- Environments do the Warhammer 40k universe justice especially the hive cities.
- Gun play is fantastic, this is what shooting a bolter should feel like
- Characters are fantastic, my the end of the game you truly feel a real connection to your squad.
- The ending boss fight is one of my favourite boss fights I have EVER played its truly breathtaking, the perfect blend of challenge, counters and length


Cons:
- Veteran difficulty is quite frankly far too punishing to play solo, the tyranid portion (specifically that damned antena mission, if you know you know) Is near impossible with the amount of damage the shooting tyranids do all while you get stunlocked by the smaller enemies
- Health is far too rare a resource. In Space Marine 1 you could refill health via executions while in Space Marine 2 it only refills shield which on Veteran difficulty only has too charges.
- Upon early release there are audio bugs thankfully never during cutscenes but it does pull you out of immersion when suddenly the game goes silent.

Ending thoughts:

I played through the entire campaign in one sitting, I had to change to Normal difficulty after the antena mission because Veteran was simply too unforgiving. However once I switched to normal and was no longer dying so quickly the game was a blast to play. Space Marine is to this day my favourite childhood game bar maybe Battlefront 2, its what got me into Warhammer 40k and is a very special piece of media to me.

Space Marine 2 is a worthy sequel, expands the scale, the carnage and everything else that made Space Marine 1 so special. This game was clearly made with love and care. Its absolutely worth a buy.",Recommended,1851,43.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

epic_doom,https://steamcommunity.com/id/epic_doom/,"A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.

Graphics
• Incredible model detail everywhere
• High fidelity and dense environments
• Loincloth physics is 👌
• World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizon

Gameplay
• Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I
• Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should
• Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured
• Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red
• Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel should

Story
• Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike
• Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible
• World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period
• Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least
• Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine.

Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege. For anyone who is a fan of the 40K universe I say this is a must buy - my only complaint is that it will leave you wanting more.",Recommended,1845,9.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

Only real issues I have with it are that Tyranids just can't compete with the Space Marine 1 Orks, and that single player almost feels like an afterthought when you look at all of the multiplayer only stuff like classes, perk systems, better weapon selections, armor customization. There are certain sections while playing the highest difficulty solo in campaign that I felt were definitely designed around having multiple players and the AI just wasn't cutting it so I had to get creative on just surviving. Not a gigantic issue and I'm sure playing the highest difficulty wasn't helping me.

Something I do want to mention is that the story is not as interesting as it could have been. Space Marine 1 had an ending that could have a much more interesting followup. Instead a more interesting short story was put in White Dwarf to kind of get Titus to Space Marine 2s starting point, and Boltgun was created to cover the other half of the story stuff they needed to put in place.

Mechanically, it's a third person action game with an emphasis on melee. Missions broadly involve progressing through a level while completing set objectives and fighting a variety of enemy types. Whether you enjoy the gameplay is very subjective, but in my personal opinion it is a challenging, yet fun experience that effectively mixes ranged and melee combat while staying engaging. Coop and PvP modes are available, with the former definitely being worth your time if you enjoy the campaign.
It is not an open world game with 50-100 hours of campaign. It is not an RPG, nor is it MMO-like.
Primarily what this game aims to be is a sequel to the first game. Don't expect a different game.
Now that that's out of the way;

Space Marine 2 is set amongst the Warhammer 40k setting, and it is abundantly clear that it has been developed with care and dedication. From the detailed, living environments to the story awareness, it is a game that has been sorely missing from the 40k franchise for some time.
I am not high brow with the stories I enjoy, but I highly enjoyed the characters and scope of the story. 14 years since we last saw Titus, it's a fitting continuation that includes additions since made to the setting. Cadia's fate, the Primaris and more are involved in an unforced and appropriate way.
There are many moments where I have to stop and look at the scenery to take it all in, and game details down to each color being matched with their actual miniature equivalent are great to see.

I would definitely consider if you have the necessary PC specifications before purchasing, as it is a hefty game. Beyond that, I haven't experienced any technical issues, and have heard of very few people experiencing them. Parts of the gameplay can feel frustrating, but I think it really is a skill situation. My only complaint is that there's not more of it.",Recommended,1592,13.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
76561198037024039,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037024039/,"Depending on what you want from the game it's either for you or not.
If you are looking for a game with the elements of a Mass Effect or maybe Rogue Trader in it's story then this ain't for you, it's a game for the people who want the old games from 2010 back, the action based third person shooter with blood and gore.
People who enjoyed the first game or even GOW, you will have a blast with the different executions, the gunplay and the overall presentation of Space Marine 2.
It feels really good to just sit down, join some friends and blast your way through a tyranid horde and watching your custom made Space Marine cutting a Warrior in halve.
The campaign itself was for my taste long enough, it had it's amazing moments with certain twists and expecially the presentation of the battlefield, how the skybox looks and the complete level design is something from another world.
You get sucked into the world of 40k in a blink of an eye, even the intro video was the sweetest eye candy I had this year but it doesn't just end there, it goes on with massive scaled battles taking place in the background and the ambiente just fits so well into this setting, so fluent and yet so sharp.

The Operations are not exactly what I expected, I do love the different perspective on the levels with the view of the other teams and what they did, it gives another nice inside on how the war against the xenos is fought.
But I would have loved a similiar kind of PVE gameplay like in Darktide, might just be me but it would suit the game more if they'd add something like that, not as repetitive like Darktide but inspired by it to say the least.
The classes all feel unique in their own way with how they play and feel like.
Customisation on the other hand is done right with the player having to play the game and not just buying in on it, I get that people like to get the easy way sometimes but honestly, that's the way I like it with Space Marine 2.
Don't get me wrong, I really love the fan service of most Warhammer games and I believe this game will do just as good as a Halo Reach in terms of said Fan Service.

The multiplayer although needs a lot of work, unfortunately there is no true customisation for the Chaos Marines which makes me quite sad, I'd love to have a full World Eater set with all the different parts of armour and insignias there are but we just have to wait for that.
Balance so far is ok-ish if you know how to counter f.e. a heavy, you won't have a big of a problem dealing with them but classes like the Assault who are just a flying target with no really prowess to themself or the Vanguard who has no real chance on surviving a encounter with a tactical is something they need to work on.
Especially the Vanguard would benefit from one armour slot more or maybe a better evasion during fights, I know it's a light class but having a sniper ripping you apart with his pistol because your hook is taking a bit to long to shoot you towards him is frustrating, might just be me but that's my opinion on it.

The game shows great promise in becoming a true sucessor to the first part and as of now it is a really good, if not even the best Warhammer game out there at this very moment, maybe Darktide is a bit better but that's just me, I love both of the games.
Space Marine 2 is a game which gives the players what they want, it's really refreshing to have a game like this combating modern gaming and showing us that there are still people out there who care about a franchise this big.

There are some technical issues I don't like that much like latency and the game not closing right, or just randomly closing the lobby in PVE and refusing to start a mission even tho everybody is present in the ready zone but honestly, it's not even fully released yet and we all payed to get our hands earlier on the game so I think it's something you can excuse as of now.
If the stability of the game will be improved or not is up to the Devs and I hope they will take their time with the new DLCs, they already did really good on WWZ but they can do even better with this one.
Can't wait to see this game becoming GOTY.

That's all from me, if there is anything you dislike or think I missed please just leave a comment on this review.

skyven08,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skyven08/,"I've found this game to be a really good sequel to the old Space Marine game, continuing the story of the protagonist from the previous game as they face new threats.

Pros:

- The production value is great. In my very first mission, I spent my game time in between gawking at the scenery, and dying to enemies (skill issue). The environs iconic to the Warhammer 40k franchise are beautifully rendered, and the dev team has had tremendous attention to detail.
- VO and story are solid so far. As of this writing, I haven't delved too much into it, as I'm eager to play this in co-op
- Combat feels representative of Space Marines: while at time clunky, there's a definite feel of momentum behind it, and both melee and ranged combat feels satisfying.

Cons:
- Performance is currently unreliable at best. Loading time on an SSD is much higher than I expect it to be. The game will try to load cutscenes, and while still loading them and stuttering, it will play the audio track, desyncing the audio track from the cutscene video completely.
- Graphical performance also heavily depends how much of the game resources you've managed to buffer. You can have a combat area with 10-20 enemies maximum, and turning too fast might cause stuttering or a slight freeze, but at the same time, if the game just throws hordes of Tyranids charging your emplacement, the game performance might be completely fine and not miss a beat. YMMV.

Not tried:
- Server / Co-op: I have yet to try the co-op functionality, so I can't give any advice on its performance.

Verdict:

Despite performance issues, I've found it a well-done game, and would definitely recommend it. Since this review was written during the pre-release time, I don't doubt that down the line the devs will release further patches to address what myself and others have seen so far when it comes to performance issues.",Recommended,1554,11.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

evil-lemon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/evil-lemon/,"I cannot believe I'm about to do this, but I am giving Space Marine 2 a hesitant Upvote. There are some two deal breakers that I seriously hope Saber Interactive fixes. But before we get into it, there is a fat Horus in the room that i need to address first:

Is it woke?
Short answer:
No, . Shut up about it and go cry to Arch about it. It's not an issue the game critically needs addressing at all.

Yes the spooky SBI did consulted on this game, but honestly I don't really see any detrimental influence so far. As for Ultramarines not looking 100% like a wet dream of an Austrian painter, lets be real. Anyone worth their Warhammer 30/40k salt knows that there is no canonical establishment of Ultramarines all needing to look like they came from the Austrian alps singing Sound of Music. Yes, all space marine take on features after their gene father (Rowboat Girlyman in this case), but Roboute's gene has far as lore goes is pretty stable and has few if any mutations.

All Salamanders look like Pele from SMT because Vulkan gene had a flaw that made everyone black with red eyes. Same goes for some others like Night Lords (scary emo goths) and probably Luna Wolves (bald and angry). Some, like the Raven Guard (sad emo goths) are as a result of their planet's environment (Kiavahr being terrible and Deliverance being a literal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a moon) or like White Scars (Mongolians) who not only Oct 7 his entire planet in about 20 solar years, but also recruited people exclusively from the tribe who took him in.

Some Legions (and by extension first founding chapters) like Iron Hands, Luna Wolves, Dark Angels, Emperor's Children, Imperial Fist and famously Ultramarines recruit anyone from anywhere so long as they are worthy. And because their genes are relatively stable, they do not completely inherent ALL of their Primarch's physical traits. Though you'd obviously find more blonde in say, Emperor's Children and Dark Angels than you would any hair on Luna Wolves.

Not exactly, but you racist AND stupid especially if you didn't know the lore, because from your perspective, why would there be an ethnic limitation in that regard? Get out of here with that you donkey.

Now with that out of the way, some thoughts about the game:

1. If you're a 40k buff, the design, scenery, voice-acting, atmosphere, weapons etc are all exactly what you'd expect Warhammer 40k to feel like.

2. Audio design for the most of it is impeccable.

3. Combat is fluid and mostly satisfying with one caveat (will elaborate in negative).

4. Beautiful graphics, even on my 3070ti at high mids it still looks fantastic.

5. Runs very great on my 3070ti, Ryzen 9 and 32gb DDR5. Though would recommend installing it on a nvme ssd to increase loading speed.

6. Only played about 1.5 hours of the campaign, but the lore so far is fantastic. How they speak, the mannerism of the Astartes, the imperials, the mechanicus etc are all as they should be.

1. ESG. This is the biggest middle finger and a complete deal breaker. Nevermind being forced a stealth installation of ESG onto your system, it ironically PREVENTS you from booting the game unless you go into task manager and DELETE ESG PROCESS. How stupid is that?

2. Second deal breaker for many, the FOV is horrible and there is no way to extend it. The space marine model eats 1/3 of your entire view, which severely reduces your peripheral awareness unless you are constantly looking around.

3. The weapons feel less impactful and heavy than they did in SM1. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if some of the weapon didn't feel so floaty/light (but then again, they are being welded by not just space marines, but Primaris so maybe it gets a pass).

4. Some weapons don't sound as punchy as it should be. The heavy bolter for example was defeaning in SM1 and especially in the Dawn of War games. Other weapons like the bolter pistol needs sound louder and more punchy (you are literally shooting a miniature rocket after all, and a normal unaugmented human can barely fire it without breaking their shoulders. Unless you're a Catachan, then you can fire anything).

5. Titus's first voice actor, Mark Strong, was way better than Clive Standen. Don't get me wrong, Clive does try hard and delivers as best he could, but there's something about Mark's voice that really suits a gruff veteran space marine.


Despite my grievance with some of the more creative decisions like the changing of Titus's voice actor and weapons sound/feel not as heavy as the first game, I understand why they did it. SM2 gameplay and combat is much more fast paced and fluid than SM1 ever was. It might be a solid reason, from a technical perspective to not have everything sounding like Ferrus Manus clapping Fulgrim's cheeks on Istvaan V or having the screen shake like it's Armageddon on a Tuesday. I can live with those decisions, not a deal breaker.

What is and WILL be a serious issue, is the presence of and the poor FOV (which can be easily fixed with an update to allow adjustments).",Recommended,4159,7.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

sk4p3g04t,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sk4p3g04t/,"I'm having fun so far, but this is not the GOTY, Helldivers 2 Killer super game people were hoping it would be before release. combat is clunky and over-complicated, but serviceable. Gunplay is fine but there are too many bolters with too few differences to make them feel like unique weapons. Reload times are universally atrocious, it should not take a space marine 3 entire seconds to reload a bolter. Melee as actually noticeable a step back from the first game, every weapon feels too slow to tackle the absolute mosh pits each combat arena descends into. The game seems to want you to square up with the elite units and take your time dodging and parrying specific attacks but you'll never be in a position to do that with all the smaller nids chewing at your ankles at all times. Execution animations are overlong and lacking in variety. I haven't even played for very long and I'm already sick of the ""stab the warrior with his own sword"" animation.

The visuals and art direction are where this game succeeds the most. every little detail oozes 40k and it really feels like the most complete rendition of the setting we've ever gotten in a game. The sheer size of some of the enemy hordes you'll see and fight are hugely impressive. If you see a wave of tyranids cresting a hill, they aren't just set dressing, they're coming for you and they're hungry. However, despite the quality of most visuals in the game, I must say that the flamethrower might just be the single worst video-game flamethrower I've ever seen. It was so bad that it actually made me stop playing so I could write this. It's frankly baffling how terrible it looks and feels to use, you'd think that the game about fighting hordes of alien bugs would have put some effort into making the ideal anti-horde weapon look and feel good, but nope. It doesn't set enemies on fire, doesn't light up the environment and doesn't leave any lingering flames behind. It's pathetic, frankly.

Overall my first impressions are mixed. More positive than negative, but if you aren't a 40k fan, I'd say you're safe skipping this one. I'd give this game a low 7/10, closer to a 6 than an 8.",Recommended,1769,10.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

76561198028358390,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028358390/,"Where do I even start. Not sure who started the rumour, but the campaign is not 6 hrs, f that. It's way longer. I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

Seizure-party,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Seizure-party/,"If you've watched any content on the game whatsoever, that is the game you are getting. No smokes and mirrors. (But I'd still hope you're properly informed on the scope of the game as a whole)

I've had this game on my radar for almost 3 years, was somewhat concerned when it got delayed a year but man am I incredibly happy they decided to because this game feels insanely polished. I played this game solely in low graphics for the entire main campaign and it still is one of the most atmospheric and gorgeous games I've ever played.

If you're familiar with Warhammer 40k in any capacity (or are somewhat of a tourist that knows some lore tidbits like myself) and you love the aesthetic and have wished for so long for a sort of immersive experience that takes place in the franchise's world in a form that ISN'T a turn based game; this is a must buy, instantly.

The campaign was amazing, around 8-9 hours of content but it felt perfect for me, not too short, not too bloated. And the finale just drove me over the edge, genuinely such an incredible high note to add on with plenty of fan-service that satisfied me and will surely make a bunch of loreheads incredibly excited and happy to see through.

Very small complaints, it would seem the game is generally scaled for 3 individual players given that the bot companions are actually not very useful at all! My recommendation if you're getting into the game with your friends is to go into veteran difficulty and experience the game that way, but I'd advise against higher difficulties solo. It's not impossible, just feels overwhelming when the enemies don't ever focus anyone but you and you're tasked with just using the best gear, leaving no real room for customization or experimentation (when it's your first time playing through the game).

Aside from that, not much else that I care about, oh aside from the final boss seemingly not letting you go in with your preferred loadout in the main campaign? Seemingly the only place that happens and I'm not sure if it's intentional. Granted I played this over the course of the first day for ultra and gold edition owners so this will surely get patched out in a week or less.

Oh and operations are incredibly cool and will be a lot of the replayability for many players with how you can customize your own class specific space marine in SO MANY LEVELS of fashion. I'm still waiting on my friends to get on since they only got the base game without the headstart, but I'm excited to play through these missions with them.

Last notes, I do wish you had some kinds of Chaos customization but I'm not damaged in any way that it isn't there. Also there is going to be a lot more content coming out in at least the next year and a half, the developers have actively released a roadmap explaning the addition of full on enemy classes and operation missions ENTIRELY FREE, with the only paid DLC coming in the form cosmetics, plus talks of adding full on playable classes in the future? We'll see if that talk actually goes anywhere but I can't say the idea of it doesn't have me thrilled.

As it stands now, I've yet to 100% the game and excited that I have plenty to experience and unlock. I'm extremely grateful for everyone involved in creating this product (that was clearly made for me since it comes out officially on the day I was born!), and I'm excited to see what comes in the future of this great game!",Recommended,2807,45.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

MommySciku,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MommySciku/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - A Review

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers an exhilarating experience that both fans of the franchise and newcomers will find impressive. Developed by Saber Interactive and published by Focus Entertainment, this sequel successfully builds on the foundation laid by the original game while introducing fresh elements to keep the gameplay engaging and exciting.


Set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40,000, the game immerses players in a desperate battle for survival. As a Space Marine, you are thrust into the chaotic struggle against the Tyranids, a relentless alien species. The narrative does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the Warhammer 40K lore, with its dark and brooding atmosphere perfectly complementing the intense action. The storyline is well-crafted, offering a gripping and emotionally charged experience that keeps players invested in the fate of the characters and the broader conflict.


The gameplay in Space Marine 2 is a standout feature. The game combines fast-paced action with deep combat mechanics, allowing players to engage in brutal, visceral battles. The combat system is robust, offering a satisfying mix of shooting and melee combat that feels both powerful and precise. The variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal ensures that combat never feels repetitive, and the ability to customize your loadout adds a strategic layer to the gameplay.

The game also introduces new mechanics and refinements from its predecessor. The improved AI and enhanced enemy variety make each encounter feel unique and challenging. The level design is top-notch, featuring intricate environments that offer tactical opportunities and add to the immersion. The seamless transition between ranged and melee combat is particularly noteworthy, allowing players to fluidly switch between different combat styles depending on the situation.


Visually, Space Marine 2 is a treat. The game boasts impressive graphics that bring the Warhammer 40K universe to life with stunning detail. The character models, environments, and special effects all contribute to a visually striking experience. The dark, gritty aesthetic of the Warhammer universe is captured beautifully, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the game.

The audio design is equally impressive. The sound effects are impactful, from the satisfying crunch of melee attacks to the deafening blasts of gunfire. The voice acting and soundtrack further immerse players in the game, with the voice work adding depth to the characters and the soundtrack heightening the tension and excitement of the battles.


The multiplayer component of Space Marine 2 is a welcome addition, offering various modes that extend the game's longevity. Whether you’re teaming up with friends or competing against other players, the multiplayer matches are well-designed and provide a fun and competitive experience. The replayability is enhanced by the variety of weapons, skills, and loadouts available, allowing players to experiment with different strategies and playstyles.


Overall, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a standout title in the Warhammer 40K series. It successfully builds on the strengths of its predecessor while introducing new elements that enhance the overall experience. With its engaging storyline, refined combat mechanics, impressive visuals, and immersive audio, it’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a compelling entry point for newcomers. The game delivers a memorable and action-packed experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",Recommended,3066,30.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

76561198047722984,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047722984/,"If you're a Warhammer fan, you will love the story and worldbuilding. If you aren't, but are taking up by the spectacle of 9-foot tall superhumans fighting side by side with baseline humans amidst cathedrals within cathedrals, you might anyway find yourself asking, ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is the deal with all these cherubs?"" or ""who is this Emperor that these one note space marines keep going on about?"" or ""if the Chaplain is wearing a skull mask, are we even the good guys?"". All of these are good questions, and I can promise you, going down those individual lore rabbit holes is just going to be unearthing a lot more what the ♥♥♥♥♥ (and is totally worth digging into).

It is presently a buggy ass mess though. My friend and I have encountered crashes during coop in two noteworthy circumstances:

1. At certain points in the campaign (and this is a repeatable crash in coop) where we had to play through the segment individually and get past that before rejoining each other in coop (seems to be related to the appearance of Spore Mines + the last area of the game). This is a hard crash to desktop;

2. When we board the Thunderhawk for deployment during the campaign, the screen fades to black and we're back on the Battle Barge sans Thunderhawk and the game just locks us out of accessing any menus, forcing a CTRL + ALT + DEL. The newest 2.66GB patch has not fixed this;

3. At one point in the game, I could not interact/pick up certain objects in the game but the host can. This meant that I had to survive the segment in melee, which was fun, but come on, the ammunition pack is RIGHT THERE and I can't pick it up. This happened only once though to be fair; and

4. Parts of a scene occasionally flash streaks of white, not unlike what you may get in Jedi Survivor, but far far less frequently and hardly at all during gameplay.

I'm a 40 year old gamer + a 40k fan so am more inured to jank than most I suppose, so while it is immersion breaking it is fairly tolerable.

76561198210201129,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210201129/,"As a die-hard Warhammer fan, I approached Warhammer: Space Marine with cautious optimism, trying to set my biases aside. So, what's my verdict? It’s… just okay. But let’s dive deeper into that.

First off, it was undeniably fun to role-play as a badass Space Marine. Mowing down hordes of Xenos was incredibly satisfying, and every execution felt intensely gratifying. The PvP mode brought a wave of nostalgia, reminding me of the old-school shooters from the 2010s. Simple, but effective—and despite being a bit undercooked, it was highly enjoyable. Admittedly, I spent most of my time in PvP after finishing the campaign. The different classes felt distinct, and each had its own utility without any glaring balance issues.

On the PvE side, it’s a solid option for some casual co-op fun with friends—perfect for those laid-back Friday nights. If you're a Warhammer fan, especially one who loves Space Marines, there’s a lot to appreciate here. The customization options for your Space Marine are extensive, letting you personalize your character as much or as little as you want, which is a nice touch.

Visually, the game is impressive, though the controls can feel a bit clunky at first. Thankfully, customizable keybindings help smooth out the experience. However, some of the animations feel stiff, and the AI companions can be frustratingly inept, especially during defense missions on higher difficulties.

The real highlight is PvP combat. While the mechanics are simple, the execution is satisfying, and the customization options, especially for loyalist Space Marines, are deep—giving off a “dress to impress” vibe reminiscent of classic games. The Heretical Astartes, though, don’t get the same love in terms of customization, which is a missed opportunity.

But this is where the praise tapers off. The story? Basic, with a straightforward premise that doesn’t leave much to chew on once you’ve put the controller down. PvP, while fun, is limited to just three game modes and a handful of maps. And, despite the engaging core gameplay, the lack of meaningful progression holds it back from being something truly special. I also encountered a few bugs that don’t seem to have been widely discussed yet. For instance, my character would sometimes randomly fly across the map, or worse, every character—including mine—would start clipping through the floors. Fortunately, reloading from the last checkpoint or restarting the game usually fixed these issues, but it was still a frustrating experience.The final boss, especially on higher difficulties, dragged on far too long, making it feel like it overstayed its welcome and left a bit of a sour taste by the end.
In the end, Warhammer: Space Marine is a decent experience, but it falls short in key areas that could have made it great.

KleineErdbeere,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/,"It's an excellent game. The campaign has non stop moments of epic and memorable scenes that are packed so densely with laconian style blunt conversations and phrases that you can smell the sweat through the screen as your character regains his faith in brotherhood. There wasn't a moment where I was bored and thought to myself that the game was being padded out, I just had fun all the way through the campaign. This all is enhanced by the badass combat, where it looks like you're effortlessly cutting down the craziest monsters in rapid succession if you're playing well, while getting your face kicked in if you don't. Parrying, doging, gunstriking, armor and your melee movesets provides so much avenue to swing your big ♥♥♥♥ around, without it feeling like you're getting everything for free, because even a few little enemies can destroy you if you go afk. You're basically forced to regain health through hits, then line up gunstrikes or executions to regain armor, which protects your health against ranged. It feels so good to do because EVERYTHING can be parried and stomped into the ground, you're like a tank inching forward through the masses of enemies, without it feeling too easy. It's like Sekiro or Elden Ring, you can parry/deflect everyone's moveset with a very generous window if you make the right choices. I hope they DON'T add health regain on executions because it would make the game feel like ♥♥♥♥, because then you turn into a brain dead execution drone who doesn't even understand gunstrikes, which ruins the skill ceiling and what makes this gameplay feel so good.

Operations is a PvE Coop mode alá Darktide that adds a whole bunch of RPG mechanics as you play through missions from the view point of another squad. You get a dozen classes to level up with, with passive skill trees, a lot of weapon variants that don't even exist in the campaign, getting full access to customize your armor and even having skill trees on weapons. These skill trees have just enough impact to make you feel like a god once you're progressing through them (ie. regenerating health on kill perks). It provides enough complexity and enjoyment that it feels like a fresh experience right after the campaign, which doesn't have much RPG elements at all.

Seriously though, the skill ceiling of the gameplay is so rewarding that this could easily be a not recommeded if they make it easier.",Recommended,1991,26.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

Incredible so far. With the tweaks above im getting a solid 80~ FPS on Linux Desktop and EAC works without issue.

mhenryblack,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mhenryblack/,"For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.

I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.

Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.

I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical.

Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting.

I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.

Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.

Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor.

It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.

Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.

For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.

Wow, where to begin, I'm only 6 hours deep into the game so far, and every expectation I've had has been shattered. When they said that hundreds if not thousands of enemy units will be on screen, they meant it. The battles are massive, the enemies unending and unrelenting, but they captured the feel of an Astartes (space marine) perfectly. The gunplay and swordplay feel terrific, the special kill animations are gory and glorious, all of the melee weapons feel like they have weight and even with the hordes of enemies, you feel powerful.

I especially enjoy seeing the imperial guard regiments in the campaign. Youll run into them regularly and they always say something about the Astartes showing up to save the day. Fighting alongside Leman Russ's and Chimeras while wielding a heavy bolter and a company of cadian troopers charging in with battle cries is exactly the experiences I was looking for in this game. Every expectation I've had so far has been exceeded bar 1.

So far my only complaints is that it takes sooooooooooo long to load into an operation mission, and it seems that others are experiencing this issue as well as I waited for 30 minutes and no one was able to connect. My other complaint is I highly recommend making some friends or convincing some to buy to play with. The AI comrades are almost useless in some fights, and on hard difficulty it really makes it tough to advance.

TLDR: Definitely worth the money so far IMO. Absolutely shattered every expectation I had going into it. I'll update my review once I finish the campaign.",Recommended,1350,93.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 5
76561198035391503,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035391503/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A brutal and thrilling adventure.
As a huge fan of the Warhammer IP, from the grim darkness of 40k to the rich tales of the Old World, Horus Heresy, and Age of Sigmar, I love it all. I played the first Space Marine game and enjoyed it, so I had high hopes for the sequel. And let me tell you, this game is fantastic.

Space Marine 2 captures the essence of 40k perfectly, immersing players in a beautifully detailed universe. The graphics are stunning, with every level well designed to showcase the dark, gothic beauty of the 40k world. From the imposing statue of Sanguinius to the intricate banners and relics, it’s clear that this game was made by fans, for fans.

The sound design is top-notch, too, with every bolter shot and chainsword swing feeling powerful and satisfying. The soundtrack and ambient noises perfectly set the mood, making every battle feel epic and intense.

One of the standout features is the use of the World War Z engine, which brings the Tyranid swarms to life in a terrifyingly perfect way. The engine handles the massive hordes seamlessly, creating a sense of terror and chaos that fits the Warhammer universe like a gauntlet. Charging into a sea of Tyranids, cutting them down by the dozens, feels exactly how a Space Marine game should.

Gameplay is smooth and responsive, with a perfect balance between melee and ranged combat. It’s fast-paced and brutal, just like the lore demands. The controls are awesome.

Overall, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. It captures the heart of the 40k universe with fantastic graphics, solid gameplay, and a deep appreciation for the lore. It’s a brutal, beautiful experience that delivers on every front.

Prepare your bolter, and dive into the fray.
Space Marine 2 is a glorious addition to the Warhammer legacy.

I will start by saying ive been a warhammer fan for 20 years, i collect the models and paint and play them and love the lore, that isn't the issue with the game i have.
The issue is the combat, melee specifically but ill talk ranged first
Ranged 95% of the time is fine some guns you can be bang on pointing the CH at enemy click and it misses, fair enough ill look past that, however if i somehow have a small chance to miss maybe its my aim but why does every single enemy with a ranged attack auto lock on and is 100% accurate? termagants legit sit 40m away sniping you perfectly every shot, granted its not a lot of damage but they aren't vindicare assassins they should still miss sometimes.
THE MAIN issue i have is the melee combat. how can you have a swarm based game where you get animation and stun locked into death? it makes melee combat pointless, dive in swing once or twice and hit heavy to stun nearby and by the time im out of animation 30 hormagants have chunked my hp down, cant even dive to evade damage as the hit you while rolling. there ia NO ANIMATION CANCEL, look at assassins creed whether you like or hate the new games the combat is so fluid, you can be mid animation, see an enemy attack, PARRY and it actually parries and cancels what you were doing to do the command.
honestly if you allow me to animation cancel and parry properly till my hearts content ill give this 10/10 like i said the atmosphere lore graphics everything else is fine just some niggling parts of combat that honestly make no sense, you cant swarm me in a swarm based game and stun lock me to death with animations that is just clunky and absurd.

The game itself is wonderful, but the content is condensed, so outside of replaying on harder difficulties, you can knock out the entire story in a day or two.

Space Marine 2 yearns for content patches and expansion packs. The story of the Operations mode is so neatly interwoven with the Campaign experience, that it's hard to believe there will be many new levels introduced outside of a full blown expansion pack that adds levels to both experiences.

Are there glaring balance issues? Yes. Are there bugs? Yes, Do I have friends who meet the minimum requirements, but still have rendering issues on some levels? Yes. All of these things are subject to improve. I am eagerly awaiting the next major content update and further optimizations.",Recommended,709,60.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

As a huge WH40K I freaked out and had to replace my brain with spare brain parts because of how many times the story mode of the game blew my MIND!

Multiplayer side of the game is AMAZING! In PvE your teammates (Brothers) are nice and respectful, they notify health kits, ammo, bombs and other stuff you need. Not a single Brother space marine I met has shown heretical behaviour!

PvP is the best multiplayer gamemode in the game, straight forward, simple matchmaking, FUN as hell and perfect for quick chaotic matches while not being rage enduring 95% of the time. Want to have fun in your 30 min break? PvP will make that break fantastic!

While there are some issues, I think the core of the game (the campaign and operations modes) are fantastic.

On the issues, there are a few quality of life problems, such as the armory not being linked between pvp and operations, meaning you have to spend a lot of time putting armor and colors together for classes on both.
Also navigating these menus, by moving through the hub, can be annoying as the game wants to find and get you in a match while you're trying to do something else.

And pvp is just very underwhelming. Mostly because of combat jankiness that clearly was not designed for pvp.

I crashed 4 times in 14 hours I've played, 2 of those were related to AMD drivers crashing which is hard to determine where the fault lies, downloading test drivers 24.10.37.10 did not resolve those issues. The other two seemed to be just random crashes.
Another problem was stuttering present throughout the entire game, in menus, during gameplay and during cutscenes at all graphics settings - mildly annoying since it cancels all key inputs that I've done.
Lastly, AI companions are tragically dumb, they rarely do anything useful and on Veteran difficulty it becomes a pain during defence sequences where you're mostly left to manage it on your own but definitely they are not impossible, unlike some reviews claim.

Once technical issues are ironed out I'd say it's a solid 8/10 but I didn't play through co-op missions and multiplayer at the moment, so final score might be subject to change.

ironsideB3AST151,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ironsideB3AST151/,"Space Marine 2 is shaping up to be an engaging action-packed experience for both seasoned fans of Warhammer 40k and newcomers to the franchise. Here's an all-encompassing review of the game based on your observations:

Pros:
- Phenomenal Graphics: Space Marine 2 delivers visually stunning landscapes, character models, and enemies. The graphics bring the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40k to life in a way that feels rich, immersive, and true to the source material. The environments and combat animations elevate the sense of scale and brutality in each battle.

- Great Gameplay & Simple Mechanics: The game offers smooth and straightforward gameplay, making it accessible even to newer players. The controls are intuitive, and while the combat feels deep enough to satisfy experienced players, it’s simple enough to pick up and enjoy without a steep learning curve.

- Variety of Difficulty Levels: For players looking for a tailored experience, the game features multiple difficulty settings. Whether you’re looking for a challenge or just a casual playthrough, you can adjust the game to your preferred level of intensity.

- Progression System: Space Marine 2 features a well-thought-out progression system, with plenty of upgrades and customization options for your character. Though the progression can feel grindy at times, especially if you're short on gaming time, it provides a sense of accomplishment as you develop your character and abilities. It encourages replayability.

- Straightforward, Action-Packed Story: The game delivers exactly what you’d expect from a Warhammer 40k title. The story is clear-cut, action-heavy, and reminiscent of video game narratives from the 2010s. For those tired of overly complicated, meandering plots, this is a refreshing return to straightforward, cinematic storytelling. The cutscenes are well-executed and add to the overall immersion.

- Perfect for Co-op Play: The game allows for co-op multiplayer, which can make the experience even more enjoyable. Playing with friends adds another layer of strategy and fun, and can greatly affect the difficulty and pacing of the game.

Cons:
- Grindiness for Some Players: While the progression system is rewarding, the grind required to unlock certain abilities and gear can be a turnoff for players who don’t have a lot of time. Depending on how long you can dedicate to playing, this might feel tedious, though it’s a staple of games with RPG elements.

- Occasional Bugs: Like many new releases, Space Marine 2 has a few technical issues. Players have reported performance drops, occasional crashes, and trouble joining co-op/multiplayer modes. However, these bugs appear to be situational, and your experience may vary. Fortunately, you haven’t encountered many problems yourself as of September 5th, but it’s something to be aware of, especially for others who might experience these issues.

- Limited Story Length: While the story itself is enjoyable, it’s on the shorter side. Depending on the difficulty you choose and whether you’re playing alone or with friends, the campaign can be completed in roughly 6-10 hours. For players who prefer longer single-player experiences, this could feel brief.

Conclusion:
- Overall, Space Marine 2 is a fantastic game for anyone looking for a visually stunning, action-packed, and accessible Warhammer 40k experience. Its simple yet satisfying mechanics, impressive graphics, and straightforward story make it a great title to dive into, especially for those who enjoy co-op play. While some may find the grind a bit much or experience technical hiccups, the overall experience is engaging and reminiscent of classic action games from the 2010s—refreshing in a world full of grind-heavy titles.",Recommended,3177,72.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

SirusTheMadDJ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SirusTheMadDJ/,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. The operations, just like with the PvP mode, is bolted on with little design beyond ""getting it working"" mechanically. Let's not pretend otherwise. It's great that it's there, don't get me wrong, but loading into it feels like the game was going to be something else other than Space Marine 2, like a third person Darktide. They even have the same briefing screen when joining a mission.

The six marines that play the classes are effectively walking one tone characters that are designed to be replaceable easily, and it's very telling that the game has a ""default"" selection of who actually goes on them to the point that the lines rarely match up. Not very jarring, given as it's effectively only two or so lines per instance it happens, but it's very clear that it's a case of ""Meanwhile, this is happening"", and that leads to thinking if it was just cut out to be replaced as just co-op optional mode rather than the mandatory sections it is now. Which likely means I can probably guess where at least one of the upcoming new missions is going to be, but I could be wrong.

Sticking to the mechanical details, both the main campaign and these side operations have no lobby options. The main campaign is mercifully friends only, but the operations are match made, meaning that frequently I found myself joining one in progress, and often a significant chuck into it. This, with other games that have done multiplayer story lobbies, is jarring when you're coming out of a briefing only to find yourself in the final section of the mission with no details between. Add to that needing to effectively pull the networking offline if you wanted to play it solo without worrying if you're slowing someone down with looking around or paying attention to the map, and it feels very cheaply thrown in to pad out an already lacking story.
This IS something that is going to change ""sometime soon"" given the season pass, however it's rather telling that it was pushed out the door a touch too soon. The PvP modes are more evident of this, given at the time of making this review, Quick match straight up doesn't work and there's barely a handful of maps. And even then, they feel almost identical, besides setting changes and the layout of the central area.

I've played a few hours of it, and frankly while it is serviceable, it is VERY clear where the main draw of the game is, even when reading the roadmap and season pass. And it's not in PvP.

So why am I recommending it? After all, that was a sizeable rant for a blue thumbs up. The short version?

Because it's more Space Marine.

The operations themselves might just be shorter sections, but they still have the same polish with the map design that the main game has. Especially with the Tyranids. Yes, they may not have the same character or different mob types than DEM KRAZY GITZ the Orks have, but then you have the numbers. Yes, technically there's less variety with them, but given the nature of the race, it makes sense. They are a hivemind that are literal billions in number, and the game loves to remind you of that in set pieces that throw massive hordes at you.

This gets shifted a bit when inevitably the spoilers start coming into effect, but there's enough going on to stop things from getting too samely. I mean, it's a game with the imperium of Man in it, but I won't ruin which flavour of inevitable.

The setting once again is nailed out of the park. Everything is exactly as you'd expect from a top flight Warhammer game, and is only improved in the sequel over the original game. What setbacks, however, are in the game's health mechanic and the melee.

The healing from aggression is still there, but now it's closer to how Bloodborne manages it. You take a hit, and you can restore back to full if you are quick and aggressive enough to deal damage, with finishers restoring any white health, plus armour, back. However, the nerf is that the recoverable section ticks down, and once lost, you only have very limited stims or your special to get it back.
This certainly is more challenging, but at the higher difficulty levels it feels almost too much of a step back. But then, that's going to differ player to player, depending if you're into the power fantasy of being a post humanoid, cybernetic master of murder or one (very powerful) person against forces too numerous to count.

The melee, on the other hand is not as fluid as it once was. This comes from the addition of a ""parry"" mechanic, and I should quickly mention it is not as ""twitchy"" as something like the Souls games have it. The game doesn't explain it well enough, beyond the ""Hit button to counter blue, dodge orange"" tells. You can literally parry any standard melee in the game, however doing so locks you in place for a moment. I think this is where the ""clunky"" comments come in, as nothing else is different than the previous game, but it gets to a point where you're not certain if blocking strikes is worth it outside of the blue tells you're ""supposed"" to be countering.
It also doesn't seem to work in PvP. You can still block melee strikes, yes, but then you're stuck in place, and the opponent can just keep swinging and swinging until they can inevitably chip you out, heavy attack to break it, or you try to roll out of it. Granted, this is likely more signs of the multiplayer modes just being bolted onto the game and the feature was more for the AI targets, or that there's little way of explaining how it works in PvP.
Outside of that, it's effectively the same as with the first game. Which, given it was perfectly serviceable there, is just as good now beyond the parry system being a touch unreliable.

But again, this count be the fact my first time through was on Veteran, and a lack of understanding on how it works. But it's still minor gripes.

Overall, I'm still going to carry on playing it. At time of this meme, I've cleared the single and co-op content at about twelvish hours. Not that I'm a believer in ""hours played = cost"" crowd, but given the launch at £55, going to £80 or £90 after the season pass and more Smurf focused DLC, I'd certainly would say slap it into a wishlist and watch what happens in a few months’ time. I'm not regretting it, but if you're just in it to follow on the adventures of Titus, new voice artist and all, I'd poke around a bit before diving in. As to if the season pass is worth it, I'd absolutely avoid pulling the trigger until there's more details.

But, nagging matters aside, it's more Space Marine. Which is absolutely fine by me, even if it is more bloody Ultramarines...

Вступление
Продолжения, одной наверное, не из многочисленных удачных по вселенной мира Warhammer 40,000 игру, многие ждали слишком давно. Все кто играл, в свое время, в первую часть Space Marin, были явно под впечатлением от всех брутальных трейлеров, начиная с 2021 года.
Так что разработчикам из Saber Interactive, которым была дана очень важная миссия, а именно не упасть в грязь лицом при создании видеоигры по данной культовой франшизе, наравне с ""World of Warcraft"".
И, слава богу, создатели еще одной номерной части приложили все свои силы для того чтобы порадовать фанатов данной вселенной, а также привлечь новых людей.

Сюжет
Начнем с того, что со времен Space Marine прошёл целый век. Капитан Деметриан Тит, по причине обвинения в ереси со стороны своего собрата Леандора, был отправлен на допрос к Инквизиции. Хотя, в будущем, обвинения были впоследствии сняты,Титу, пришлось вступить в Караул Смерти, где ему пришлось отслужить пол века. В конечном итоге, в результате попытке остановить вторжение Тиранидов - расы жукоподобных существ, основная цель которых пожирать систему за системой, в системе Рекидиус на планете Кадаку, Тит был смертельно ранен, но его быстро спасают новоприбывшие Ультрамарины. После пробуждения, Тит встречает капеллана Квинта, которые рассказывает о прохождении Рубикона Примариса по приказу магистра Марнеуса Калгара. Тит хочет вернуться в Дозор Смерти, но Квинт напоминает ему, что он был освобожден от влияния Хаоса и что если он действительно хочет искупить свои грехи, то он должен помочь своим братьям. Титус принимает доспехи Примариса и Квинт советует ему сохранять своё прошлое в тайне и докладывать капитану Акерану о своих делах. Акеран назначает Титуса командиром отряда, в состав которого входят братья Кайрон и Гадриэль. В целом, весь сюжет будет вертеться вокруг попытки Империума человечества остановить Тиранидов, а в последствии столкнуться с силами Хаоса.

В целом, Space Marine 2 продолжает идеи своей предшественницы: это шутер от третьего лица, совмещённый с жанром hack and slash. Игроку придётся использовать как дальнобойное оружие для сражения со слабыми врагами, так и холодное оружие для борьбы с более сильными врагами, так как пули на них не действуют. Здоровье восстанавливается, если добить врага или использовать лечебный стимулятор. Броня восстанавливается сама по себе со временем. В сюжетную кампанию можно играть как одному, так и втроём. Также, в игре имеются и полностью сетевые режимы, например, битвы в формате 6-на-6.
EN:
The continuation, probably not one of the many successful games in the universe of the world of Warhammer 40,000, many have been waiting for too long. Everyone who played, at one time, the first part of Space Marin, was clearly impressed by all the brutal trailers, starting in 2021.
So the developers from Saber Interactive, who were given a very important mission, namely not to fall into the dirt when creating a video game based on this iconic franchise, on a par with ""World of Warcraft"".
And, thank God, the creators of another numbered part did their best to please the fans of this universe, as well as attract new people.
The sequel has become noticeably bigger, better and grander. Although it is based on a familiar foundation laid by the authors of the original.

Let's start with the fact that a whole century has passed since the time of Space Marine. Captain Demetrian Titus, because of the accusation of heresy by his brother Leandor, was sent for interrogation to the Inquisition. Although, in the future, the charges were subsequently dropped, Titus had to join the Death Guard, where he had to serve for half a century. Eventually, as a result of an attempt to stop the invasion of the Tyranids, a race of beetle-like creatures whose main purpose is to devour system after system, into the Rekidius system on the planet Kadaku, Titus was mortally wounded, but he was quickly rescued by the newly arrived Ultramarines. After waking up, Titus meets Chaplain Quintus, who tells him about the passage of the Rubicon Primaris on the orders of Magister Marneus Kalgar. Titus wants to return to the Deathwatch, but Quintus reminds him that he has been freed from the influence of Chaos and that if he really wants to atone for his sins, then he must help his brothers. Titus accepts Primaris' armor and Quintus advises him to keep his past a secret and report to Captain Akeran about his affairs. Akeran appoints Titus as the commander of the squad, which includes the brothers Kiron and Gadriel. In general, the whole plot will revolve around the attempt of the Imperium of mankind to stop the Tyranids, and subsequently face the forces of Chaos.
In general, Space Marine 2 continues the ideas of its predecessor: it is a third-person shooter combined with the hack and slash genre. The player will have to use both long-range weapons to fight weak enemies, and cold steel weapons to fight stronger enemies, since bullets do not work on them. Health is restored if you finish off an enemy or use a therapeutic stimulant. The armor regenerates on its own over time. The storyline campaign can be played either alone or as a threesome. The game also has fully online modes, such as 6-on-6 battles.",Recommended,4618,15.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

The execution animations bother me a lot less than I thought and they are pretty quick to finish. The melee and ranged combat is pretty good, a tiny bit clunky but not bad.

Mostly I feel it is pretty hard to avoid BS damage at the moment and easy to get whittled down, even if you're spamming execution and parry like a well timed madman.

wintertank,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wintertank/,"This game came as a bit of a surprise, since the first instalment of the series was a moderately successful title that left fans wanting more. Now, 13 entire years later, we get a sequel that turbo boosts the concept of the original in every way imaginable.
You still play as Titus, but now you have a squad that follows you in every mission, and the main enemy for the first half of the game are Tyranids.
Said Tyranids have some of the best dynamic swarm movement I've ever seen in a videogame thanks to the dev's experience with similar mechanics on games like World War Z.
They can break off into clusters, pile on top of walls and generally act like a real horde, not a pre-scripted bot puppet.
Graphically, the game is truly impressive, perhaps one of the best I've ever seen. I never tire of looking at the vast, grandiose cities going down in flames as battles rage on in the distance, with swarms of aliens descending from the skies while battleships fire at them. The design of the marines and maps is also spot-on, Warhammer fans (myself included) will rejoice at the small details on every character and building model.
Of course, such heavy graphical fidelity comes at the price of performance, and the game does need a beast of a PC to run: with an RTX4070 ti, I could only manage 60-90 FPS at 1440p with everything maxed, with dips below 60 in extremely messy scenes. Still, DLSS did its job (I'm sure that without it, performance would be even worse) and the game hasn't crashed in over 12 hours of play so far.
Sound design is also good, with special mention going to the weapon effects: one can only describe them as...meaty.
Now, to the main point: the gameplay is limited, but enjoyable. What I mean by this is that you won't get any complex plots, open maps and huge skill trees here: story mode is almost completely linear, point A to point B, kill enemies, cutscene, repeat. You have some loadout options, but overall it's really not worth playing more than once.
However, it is very fun, and it doesn't overstay its welcome at an average duration of 8-10 hours (side missions excluded).
The melee combat didn't click much for me personally, with an awkward parry system and combos that can be performed with only one button. The ranged, third-person shooting is very satisfying though.
After you're done with the story, you have two main modes to discover: the side missions that are heavily coop-focused and have their own class and progression system, and the PvP multiplayer.
Said missions are much more challenging than the main story and require you to use your combined abilities and weapons to succeed, while offering weapon leveling, special abilities, small skill trees and marine customization options.
The PvP is serviceable, offering the usual modes ones would expect (capture point, team death match etc.) while including a modified version of the skill trees used in the other mode. It runs much better performance-wise (120 FPS) and it feels alright, not exactly an afterthought but certainly not the mode the devs have put the most work on. For example, they could have added extra features like vehicles, turrets, abilities unique to each faction or even the ability to control Tyranids ala Left 4 Dead to make it more exciting.
Most of the criticism I can throw at this game is simply my wish for more of it: more missions, more weapons, more classes and definitely more factions. Happily, the devs have promised exactly that with the roadmap: we'll get further updates along the way, for free (with a paid cosmetic option) and a very likely expansion in the future, as the ending of the main story hints at more adventures.
Given the commercial success of the title, I'm sure we'll get all of that and more.

76561197983593071,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983593071/,"30 hours in and I'm going to iterate on what I find nice:

Melee - It's a LITTLE wonky with some animations taking longer or being shorter depending on weapon, though some feel a bit clunky with how they lock you. However parrying and dodging are mixed well into it, gunstrike's making melee a little forgiving but you are sadly unable to get into the thick of it like Space Marine 1.

Ranged - Guns feel punchy, they are satisfying to use, some perhaps taking more of a learning curve but they're all very much viable. The Heavy Weapons especially. There isn't much else to say other than some ranged weapons can fulfill a role much better than others and some can be jack of all trades.

Enemies - Ehhh...some of them feel okay to fight but are a little overtuned. My gripe is with the Termgant and Tzangor. Why these two? Because the Termagant is a swarm based ranged unit that can come in a dozen per wave doing way too much damage for how accurate they can be and how numerous they can be. A lot of people go 'skill issue' well how is it a skill issue when the enemy has a nigh 100% accuracy with every shot they make, and each shot chips away your armor like it is a literal piece of air, Termagants feel overtuned.

Why are Tzangor's mentioned? They're a melee swarm unit with SHIELDS, why is that bad? Unless you use MELTA you are not getting through the shield. I can see WHY they gave SOME shields and not all, but the shields feel like they're a bit much, because they don't take damage until they either lower the shield or you manage to get around them. Not to mention on higher difficulties, a single Tzangor can take down 1 to 2 Armor bars, and a good chunk of HP. These little guys, come in packs of 20 or more in the waves.

Story - If you've played Space Marine 1 you are in the right ball-park of how this goes, but there is a decent bit of twist to it. I will say that of all things, the story felt good. It felt like a proper Warhammer 40k story rather than just something tacked on as a second thought.

Overall? Yes I do recommend it, but I would also recommend tempering expectation. Some enemies feel overtuned, dodge timing is a little wonky and I'm STILL trying to get it down after finishing campaign and playing on Substantial threat level in Operations.

The game is wonderful, but there are some parts that need more time in the oven to be considered a full part of the meal. Some enemies that need more tuning to be considered a challenge fully, rather than just a bit of an unpredictable mess.

For those who say Skill Issue, I'd like actual REASONS as to why you're going to say that rather than just you saying it and moving on without properly elaborating, because all that tells me is that you haven't actually played the game that long, and/or you don't care about others in the game than yourself.",Recommended,2313,50.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

pow20o09,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pow20o09/,"Game is good, but has room for some extra polish or optimizations.

The story is a good power trip where the content feels challenging but you have the tools to do it.

Thankfully these segments are few and far between. PVP is also fun with 6v6 matches and is enjoyable even though the modes are pretty basic.

My biggest complaint right now is the fact PVP map pool is only 3 maps. The road map indicates a new map in 2025 but that means 3+ months grinding on only the current small pool. This and the slow pace of unlocking gear in PVP, I can see being a point of burnout for people. Also PVP matches really need to shuffle teams as two three mans can queue snipe each other to doom stack a lobby. Just general flow around menuing for PVP is also kinda clunky between the amount of load screens and waiting. For instance you can't edit your loadout in match, you must finish your game, then load into your battle barge, go to the armory and wait for the robo boy to slowly come down all while a timer ticks for the next match. To the point why even bother loading into the barge when all of this could just be menus you can flip through post match. And on the point of load screens god they are a pain.

Space Marine II takes everything we loved about the original and just cranks it up, polishing it all to a sheen. This is very clearly a work of love by developers deeply immersed in the setting and the world, providing the best presentation I have ever seen of war in the 42nd Millennium.

We get to see sights, enemies and locations that have been crafted with a meticulous eye for detail and every single facet of it oozes atmosphere. I can not recommend this enough if you have even a passing interest in Warhammer 40k.

Every weapon is meaty and powerful, every enemy dies convincingly and feels satisfying to defeat.

Took me roughly nine hours to finish the singleplayer campaign and it was absolutely worth it for that alone, and I still have my Operations to do and I frankly can't wait.

The online part of the game is fun too, simple yet engaging, specially with the customization parts you unlock through progress (a novelty in the current microtransactions age).

Overall despite the stupid decisions GW has made throughout the years and how they turned their backs on their true customers, you know the ones who actually used to buy their products, I can't fault this game.

- If you see something in this game and think it's cool, the actual model can also have it - As someone who knows what Tyranids can be equipped with, it's wonderful seeing that loadout come to life

I was half expecting this game to be World War Z with 40k assets, and have been pleasantly surprised that that isn't the case. You really feel like a big ol' chonky space marine smashing your way through hordes of gaunts, but you still feel how formidable Tyranid warriors, carnifexes, etc. are in comparison, which is how it should be!

Great game, with endless potential for them to add more content, I really hope Saber keep up the good work, keep adding content (in the same way they did with WWZ). There's a whole franchise's worth of content that they could add, and I really feel like they would do any of it justice.

imperviousmike,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imperviousmike/,"ALL OPINIONS ARE BASED ON ANGEL OF DEATH DIFFICULTY PLAYED SOLO. THEY MAY NOT BE ISSUES ON LOWER DIFFICULTIES

This is a good game, a game with alot of issues but I do recommend it if you are even slightly interested in WH40K

Combat is pretty good, the parry system can sometimes have issues if multiple parries come up. If you time one right but then another pops up it seems to cancel it sometimes and you get hit when you were not even trying to parry the 2nd attack. The dodge always seems to work, but the problem is this game has some really wonky hitboxes so you will get hit dodging and wonder what even hit you (espicaly with bosses oh god its bad with bosses) where they have invisible hitboxes that will hit you even if you arn't even close. The Carnifex was the worst for this but its manageable.

The healing system is awful on Angel of Death, the melee to restore health becomes pointless because you take so much damage you never get any back with all the enemies jumping at you. And health injectors are so rare, for many sections of the game its laughable. Your fury mode becomes the main option for healing, where you want to avoid combat and stand there and recharge but it feels counter intuitive to what it was actually meant for

The guns feel great but they sound really, really weak. I don't know if its a mixing issue or something but they lack any real oomph to them and bolters sound more like you are firing a semi automatic pistol or something and it kinda sucks, but gameplay wise I found myself using almost all the weapons at one point or another and getting results with them. Which leads to alot of experimentation and exploring the systems which is really good.

There are some major bugs, some levels glitch out and you cant pickup guns or items(looking at you cargo elevator) and also sometimes the AI totally bugs out and will just refuse to rez you, they will walk towards you then get distracted and run back and forth while your meter ticks down and its infuriating. Sometimes the AI just totally loses it and will just stand still and do nothing for large periods of time. Also randomly when Acheran was giving his speech in the hanger I walked up to watch it and a space marine came up behind me and trapped me and I had to reload the entire game because I got stuck which was really random.

The game falls into the trap difficulty wise what alot of games do, which is just turning things into bullet sponges that do alot of damage as opposed to real difficulty. Ghost of Tsushima mastered this, and honestly on Angel of Death if they just lowered the health pools on some enemies and kept literally everything else the same it would be way more tolerable and actually fun. Having to put 4 clips from a bolter run to get a full reload and then another couple clips into a Zoanthrope to just get it to go down becomes a point of hilarity. Although this is remedied by just having Krak grenades(which the game seems to keep forgetting you have because grenade pickups basically become extinct in the certain parts of the game)

The campaign at times becomes kind of a slog when many of the major set pieces s just stand here, and do the thing that prevents meter in the top corner from going down/up. Its distracting having to watch the meter while you want to actually look at whats going on, on the screen and annoying because it feels uninspired after you do it for like the 6th time.

Now all my complaints I had though, are entirely remedied with the sections of the game with the jetpacks. I honestly think they should of just built the entire game as Assault Troops because it feels amazing. The quick movement to escape hordes, jumping in and out of melee, picking off enemies in the air. It feels like thats how the game should be played. It almost turns into a doom-esque with how fast paced it becomes and its glorious.

The pvp is also fantastic and I think if they keep updating with maps and unlockables it has a real leg to stand on.

I've only played the campaign so far.
Watch a video or stream before buying to see if it is your thing.

Pros:
- You feel the weight, strength, and agility of an armored space marine.
- You'll shout ""For the Emperor!"" and ""Death to xenos!"" while crushing endless hordes (characters in-game shout it too).
- Storyline, characters, lore, atmosphere, and animations: excellent.
- Gameplay and mechanics: decent.
- Visuals: stunning.
- Audio: good music but lacks a better sound stage during action, cutscenes, and events. Battle sounds are often muffled and generic.
- Technical/optimization: okay for 2024. Runs smoothly at 4K@60 fps on a 5800X3D with a 3080Ti on ultra settings with DLSS in performance mode.

Cons:
- Connection issues affect single-player: Requires an internet connection and can lose connectivity, forcing mission restarts from the last checkpoint. Allows continuing offline, but this problem recurred even during the end credits, interrupting them.
- Co-op campaign is essential; solo doesn't work well. Bot companions are primitive, forcing the player to handle all tasks and boss attacks.

My primary gripe is the game's story forgetting about this neat little thing called the Shadow in the Warp. For those not in the know, this is a little mechanic the Tyranids use to completely isolate a region of space prior to their invasion, and it makes Warp travel and Astropath Communications just not work. Meanwhile, the Imperium is just sending Astropathic messages like they're completely unaffected.

Also, what was with that weak virus bomb? A virus bomb is supposed to completely eat a planet's atmosphere and everything, yet nothing happened when it was launched?

As a long warhammer fan I must say that this game is absolutely awesome. They took what was great on first Space Marine and improved it. Campaign is breathtaking, multiplayer is fun and no live service crap anywhere in the game. No always online requirement or in game currency that could be bought for real money, not any events, daily quests etc., just plain old fun. Even looking at the roadmap it seems that even the DLC will be just cosmetics and everything else will be just free update for the game.

They also stay true to the lore and doesn't invent anything that doesn't belong in WH40k universe, even the details from the way the space marines moves to the sound of the weapons is how I always imagined that. The horde system for tyranids also looks really great, if you see how hundreds of them are charging towards you it's really impressive sight.

Further disclosure for future context, this is written during the early launch so some of it might change in day 1 patches or later updates.

COMBAT
The game feels pretty good in general, like an update to Space Marine 1, exactly like it should. Control scheme is a little different but the features and feel are basically all still intact, there are minor differences in it that prevent things like the old short hops/instant slam combos that I do miss, however that may just be rose tinted goggles for classic jankiness. My only real gripes so far are two things:

For starters, health and defenses feel so much lower across the board than the first game, there are times I honestly feel like swiss cheese the moment I get touched by anything whether it's PvP or PvE and it doesn't seem to matter the class either as armor disappears if something looks at you wrong let alone attacks you, and it takes much longer to regen too.

Secondly executions. I have no idea what possessed them to change executions to only restoring armor, but it does not feel as remotely rewarding as SM1, this also exacerbates the other issue, because what good does regaining my armor do when the moment the execution finishes and I'm being swarmed again it instantly gets knocked off. It honestly feels like someone on the dev team looked at potions and medkits from Vermintide and thought ""let's just do that"" without considering the impact it'd have to shoehorn those into a game not originally designed for them, at the cost of the original healing mechanics.

That aside the new parry and Gun Strike both feel pretty fantastic and definitely add some to very basic and stripped down hack n' slash of the original game, especially when you can chain them on some of the meatier enemies. First getting a well timed parry, leaving them vulnerable to the gun strike for critical damage, which stuns them for an execution. This creates a pretty great flow and definitely rewarding when you quickly burst down some otherwise bullet sponge like enemies.

VISUALS
Looks wise, the game so far has been very vibrant and detailed with some set pieces/moments that visually tie in greatly with the gameplay, such as seeing large hordes in the distance that would in almost any other game be just background visuals while you fight waves off, but here they actually are the wave you're fighting and I think it ties in amazingly with the theme of having to deal with a flood of Nids. There are some other great visual/gameplay tie in set pieces but I don't want to mention too much.

STORY
I won't touch on too much on story due to not having finished it, but it makes some rather predictable turns so far, as well as some contrived convenience for plot. But it's 40k, I didn't come here looking for Shakespeare or the pinnacle of realistic storytelling, rule of cool is king in 40k, and so far it's been delivering on that.

MULTIPLAYER
It is looking pretty good in general so far, the addition of co-op to the campaign is a big win for sure and feels great to grab some friends and play through, the PvP is pretty much the same as SM1 with the exception of the issue I mentioned previously, and the larger variety of classes is nice. Having a more objective/goal focused mode with Operations as opposed to the old Exterminatus wave survival is interesting, but I do hope to see the wave survival return.

CUSTOMIZATION
Now here is something that I do have some annoyances with. First off, every color should be available for any slot with primary, secondary, and tertiary. If they want to make them unlockables for more of a gameplay loop and reward system(especially considering the lack of distinct armor marks like 1 had) then fine. But there is absolutely no reason to have colors restricted to slot, like why is it that I can ONLY color trim gold but not use it as a primary if I want? Between that and the lack of patterns for more detailed color schemes like different colored thigh armor to boots, and individual hands(noticed Crimson Fists absent as a pre-set this time, the Iron Fists also lack their single metallic colored glove) it really feels like just an objective step back with the feature this time around. I really hope in the future they make it so that you can choose unlocked colors in any slot, and that they make colorations like the Crimson Fists possible.

SUMMARY
The game is a perfectly serviceable and generally improved game over the first, other than the couple minor issues I ranted about, I've not had any real issues with the game other than a couple bugs/connectivity issues which I'm sure will be worked out shortly, likely before it's scheduled launch date or as a Day1 patch. So all in all if you liked the first game, or just a pretty big Warhammer fan in general, I see this as a must have right along with Space Marine 1.",Recommended,4099,11.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 6
76561198043341279,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043341279/,"Brothers, Space Marine 2 is a triumph of the Emperor’s will, a beacon of His light in this grimdark galaxy. From the moment the ceramite-clad boots of our revered Captain Titus hit the battlefield, you will feel the weight of your duty to the Imperium. Every bolt round fired, every xenos butchered, and every battle cry echoes with the glorious might of the Adeptus Astartes, as it should, brothers.

The game captures the brutal, unyielding reality of the 41st millennium. The combat is visceral, raw, and unforgiving—just as we expect from the eternal war that is our existence. Every swing of your chainsword bites deep, every shot from your bolter obliterates the heretic, the mutant, the alien filth. There is no mercy, no hesitation—only righteous fury.

But beyond the combat, Space Marine 2 immerses you in the brotherhood of the Astartes. You can almost feel the ancient machine spirit of your armor as you stand shoulder to shoulder with your battle-brothers, unbreakable in your resolve. The atmosphere drips with the decay of a dying galaxy, where hope is but a flicker, and the only truth is war.

The visuals, brothers, are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The gothic architecture of the Imperium looms large, casting deep shadows over blood-soaked battlefields. The enemy is legion, and each one more vile than the last, but you—an angel of death—stand above them all, delivering judgment in the Emperor's name.

In truth, Space Marine 2 is not just a game, it is a holy crusade. It reminds us why we fight, why we bleed, why we die. For the Emperor. For humanity. For our brothers.

Praise be to the God-Emperor, brothers. This is war as it was meant to be. And we shall be victorious.

Verdict: 10/10. Only in death does duty end, and this duty is glorious. My PLEDGE IS ETERNAL SERVICE.

necrophoria,https://steamcommunity.com/id/necrophoria/,"If you are trying to measure this as strictly a standalone video game, and aren't buying this for the IP, it delivers on an 7-8 out of 10 experience fairly well. Nothing too crazy, no standout feature, no unique mechanics.

It's a really polished and good looking 3rd person shooter which reminds you of what the bar once was for that genre. Think a 2010s game with 2024 graphics. Move from one area to the next shooting all enemies, rinse repeat. There is no progression of any kind barring the story. There is also no mid-game ability unlocks unlike games. What you see is what you get from mission 1 to the end minus some set piece levels with a flamethrower and a jetpack.

For 40k fans though, which I am, this delivers on every promise as a space marine simulator. You now get to BE the little model you spent hours painting (with even the option to customize using actual games workshop paints in multiplayer), and allow yourself to be immersed in the frontline of those epic battles you imagine when you play tabletop. The voice acting is everything you expected. From over the top macho yelling, to fervent screams, and all in the name of the holy emperor.

Folks may complain about the simplicity of the game, which is why I started with that point. Still, if you know your 40k lore, and know what to expect of space marines as a whole without dumb expectations (such as characterization from beings who only exist for war), this is all you you would ever need in a space marine game.

Will add this not my first shooter since coming from Planetside, Helldivers 2 and many others.
Played the game when it came out earlier and finished the campaign in under 15 hours, it gave me Mass Effect 3 vibes.
So much lore packed into a story and you don't get to experience it all unless you play Operations as well.
Been learning so of the lore from my friends who are either big fans or played the games before.

It nice to see not only the main characters but the side characters also have a part to play in the story and how their part plays out in ops. You get the play as them and see how their own mission goes and takes part in the game.

Would like to see more customisation like changing the helmet visor colour since you do get a helmet with green and the rest are red. Looking forward to seeing what coming next, hopefully more ops, story missions and maybe new classes.",Recommended,795,40.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

FOR THE EMPORIUM!!!!!!!!!!

This game is worth playing because it contains a number of distinctive and fascinating features. from the remarkably smooth fighting to the depth of the narrative. This game's harsh, graphic combat effectively captured the workings of battle. Ripping and tearing through many opponents to rescue a fallen comrade as your comrades supply supplementary fire. The feeling of power this game gives you is beyond words. Throughout this game I found out how energizing it is to rip a human-sized bug in half using just your bare hands or sawing them into bits with a chainsaw sword. I would characterize this game as having a cool factor. This game probably has everything you could possibly think of that's cool and it makes an amazing spectacle. The only downside is that there are a few bugs that need fixing, however the game is young and the developers plan to keep posting fixes and new content, (for which I am excited). They already solved an issue I was facing on launch, and the game runs perfectly.

Oh and there's some need to fix the matchmaking as when people drop from the party sometimes they're not replaced if you do actually want a team of real people. Other than that been loving the Assault class for the mobility. Fun game, probably a 7.5/10 overall.",Recommended,507,81.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
Tesla-7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tesla-7/,"This is a breath of fresh air, both in the gaming industry and for a games workshop IP. A unique experience that lives up to my unrealistically high hype. The few issues that are in the game will be easy for the devs to fix, and with how quick they have been to remedy the couple of bugs on launch, I believe they will handle it fast.

PROS:
-Unique gameplay
-Beautiful graphics
-Animations are brutal and beautiful (think of the og 'For Honor' executions), though a few more execution animations could be nice just since they happen so often.
-The weight and feel of the gameplay makes you really feel like a Space Marine
-Story is top tier, I won't spoil it but I reccomend playing the first game or watching a story summary before playing the story for this game.
-PVE is fun and replayable, even tho there are a limited number of missions, there are some randomized bits that can happen during them and it feels special when they occur
-Customization is fun and 90% are only earnable through gameplay
-The exception to the point i just made above are cosmetics from the seasonal passes, but I am perfectly fine with this because the roadmap shows that all content additions and non-cosmetics from the seasonal releases are completely free.
-There were some crashing issues on the 4 day early access, but within the first day all of the crashes I experienced were patched. The devs QUICKLY address stuff and that gives me hope that the following cons will be remedied soon

Cons:
-In the PVE mode you cannot play the same class as another player. Personally I think that it wouldn't hurt the balance too much to allow this, and it should be allowed so players can play the way they would like. The main issue with this, however, is that matchmaking doesn't match you based on your class and you will often run into lobbies with players all wanting to play the same class. They should take a note from how DRG handles classes and overlap.
-Similarly, in PVP only two players can be the same class. While this at least allows some overlap, it forces some players to play as melee focused classes, which is problematic due to the next issue
-The PVP mode has some balance issues with melee classes being almost entirely useless, but to be fair I'm not too sure how it could be fixed. Also armor customization for the chaos marines in pvp is really limited.
-Controls are a bit weird to get used to, and rebinding is limited (specifically i wanted to change the interact button and execution button, which were both E, to both be F but it would only let me have one be F because they ""conflict"" even though the default controls ""conflict"" on E).
-No FOV slider, which when your character takes up half the screen can be a bit of a pain

Con: menu UI and game controls designed for Console making it EXTREMELY awkward to navigate on PC.
Load screen times are IMPOSSIBLE. it takes 5+ minutes to ""join a server"" this is a server side issue they simply vastly under prepared server capacity for launch but it is virtually unplayable - fine once in game but getting there and out again takes AGES. Dial Up is faster. They also have EVERYTHING server side so latency, hit detection, joining with friends, loading maps, loading hub, everything takes a full server load in instead of being user side.

Glory to the Emperor!

Ok so, after 40 hours playing mostly operations I still recomend the game with some caveats.

The campaign is amazing.

The difficulty pushing in OPS tho is retarded.
There are so many problems with difficulty that has been written by me and DodoSwarm on the offical forums I will just link the thread.



Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.


Update: I am now farming ruthless consistently so don't mind the last couple of pharagrahs.

Pizza dough:
14 g instant yeast
617g water - 95F
950g all-purpose flour
19g fine sea salt
25g granulated sugar
American Pizza Sauce and Toppings:
1 tablespoon (14g) butter
1 tablespoon (9g) extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, rough chopped
2 teaspoons (4g) red pepper flakes
28 oz (794g) can of crushed tomato
2 teaspoons (2g) dried oregano
1.5 tablespoons (21g) granulated sugar
salt and pepper to taste
Splash of olive oil
2 cups (227g) low moisture mozzarella, fresh grated
2 cups (200g) Monterey jack cheese, fresh grated
1/2 cup (26g) parmigiano reggiano, fresh grated
American Pizza Dough:
Preheat the oven and a baking steel or pizza stone at 500F for 45 minutes before utilizing it.
Whisk yeast and sugar into your water, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, add flour and salt and mix by hand to combine. Pour your water mixture into your flour and mix by hand until you get a rough dough, then transfer to a work surface and knead until it starts to pull away from the work surface and is relatively smooth.
Place your dough in a greased bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature or until double in size.
Punch down your dough and dive into 300g pieces. Form those pieces into balls and place them in a floured proofing pizza box, cover with a lid, and proof at room temperature for 3 - 4 hours. (If you do not have a proofing pizza box, you can use a floured baking sheet, cover it with an inverted baking sheet and wrap it in plastic wrap.)
American Pizza Sauce and Toppings:
In a medium sauce pot, add butter and olive oil. Set that over medium-high heat; once the butter melts add garlic, cook until fragrant, add pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic begins to brown on the edges.
Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and a splotch of olive oil, boil over medium-high, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally or until thickened and viscous—season with salt to taste and let it cool down.
Assembly.- Place one of your pizza doughs onto a floured pizza peel, and flour your dough generously.
Punch your dough down in the center, working your way out to create a ¼” wide. Pick up your dough, place it over your closed fists, and rotate it around, gently stretching to 13” to 14”.
Place a couple of spoons of your sauce, starting in the center, spreading in little circles, and working your way to the edge until it gets evenly spread out.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, place mozzarella cheese, Monterey Jack, and Parmigiano; mix until combined. Sprinkle your cheese mixture to your desire and place in the oven onto your baking steel and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until the edge gets golden brown and the cheese melts.

HiriuZone,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HiriuZone/,"So far 8 hours in, played a good chunk of co-op with friends, public co-op, a few public pvp matches and roughly 90 minutes of singleplayer. Didn't personally have any performance issues aside some minor screen tearing in cutscenes that I choose to suffer as vsync gives me a surprising amount of input lag right now. Had gotten it as a gift but I'm trying my best to treat it with the same scrutiny of a $90 price tag they took on for me to play.

Gameplay's really good, solid blend between melee and gunplay, you can't hard tunnel into one or the other, especially not gunplay, melee rewards you for being aggressive through armor and health regen (Rallying from bloodborne, you can't infinitely keep healed in most cases but you won't hurt for HP when you learn your best and worst gear) and with the relatively decent roster of weapons you won't feel like one part is too stale to try to master - though the ranged enemies in this can be overbearing at times when the full roster of enemies starts to come into play.

Can't speak much of the story yet, as of writing this I'm not horribly far in as I went into the co-op specific mode to grind so I can join sept9 marines and help them get into the fray quicker, as well as spoil myself with the cosmetic system.

The soundscape's close to perfect but there's small things that don't sound quite as satisfying as they should (Stalker Bolt Rifle and Bolt Sniper Rifle having roughly the same impact per trigger pull despite one being much more higher impact and slower gunplay being an example).

Controls in this are a lot to manage and frankly having sprint tied to two separate buttons; one overlapping with your dodge button with no way to disable the overlap also causes it to not function as consistently as it should which leads to some frustration in the more hectic gameplay. It's mostly a skill issue, but I still feel like this isn't a good design choice all the same and there's other minor control hiccups.

There's a fair few bugs and performance issues that should be researched before making the purchase, but between several friends of varying mid range spec computers, nobody has had more than some heating issues that were within safe playable standards for any length of game sessions aside the marathon length time.

All in all so far an easy 8.5/10 or maybe even 9/10, if you're new to WH40k like I am then it's a little weird as an entry point, but still a massive blast as far as an entertaining videogame goes.",Recommended,2046,55.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

Title: A Glorious Return to the Grim Darkness of the Far Future

If you thought the first ""Space Marine"" game was a one-hit wonder, then ""Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2"" is here to bash that doubt out of your skull with the force of a Thunder Hammer. This sequel isn't just a game; it's a full-blown crusade into the heart of the 41st millennium.

SerjRenji,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SerjRenji/,"The positives:

Graphics
Scale
Gore
Models
Music
Atmosphere
Campaign although short its terrific.

The bad:

Weapons feel weak
Boss fights - seriously we came to slaughter and you make me hit one enemy with 20-30 mags to kill him?
Combat - as above, the weapons feel to weak, there's no real way to parry and the one in place for combos doesnt work on it's own. Enemies always target only you hitting your teammates only some times.
AI - Team Squad NPCs feel terrible, they suffer uselesness, I don't know why we have them in the first place?
Level design - became boring really fast, exploration is not rewarded and each swarm feels scripted.

Overall 4/10 Cause I can't stand that after what happened to Helldivers - Developers still think that making big guns weak is fun, no it's not fun. Guns are GUNS, and BIG GUNS NEED TO DO BIG DAMAGE. If Space Marine needs to put 30 mags into one big enemy what use are the Cadians anyway?

Im really dissapointed and Ill wait for a balance.

After some time the game grew up on me, I still hate low ammo counts, still hate low variety of missions but ultimately I loved it enough so that I continue playing it, therefore it is a matter of honor to change review to recommended.",Recommended,1021,87.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

I need to change my review about this game!!! Since this latest patch today on the 11th - I have to say I haven't crashed once due to memory consumption. The game is now only using only 14G out my total of 32G.

I can now say Space Marines 2 is an amazing game with rich art set pieces and graphics, great game play and action combat mechanics - best played on Veteran mode.
They really knocked it out of the park with this one, even the small attention to detail I found in game was so cool and immersive.

BehrKaffee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BehrKaffee/,"So, I am going to give this a pretty early review.

Its pretty good. There are a few issues, such as long loading times or issues with joining servers as of launch. But, that could be due to the overall stress of numbers trying to play right now. Much is lieu of what Helldivers dealt with early on.

The game itself just BLEEDs 40k. This is a MUST for any Warhammer 40k fan if only for the sight of a Dark Angel Bladeguard and a Space Wolf Hound of Morkai not killing each other because there are Thousand Sons to dust.

Gameplay is solid. All personal opinion, but the Melee is satisfying and the counters and dodging feel rewarding. The melee really rewards a more methodical and dueling flow to the fight and actually punishes random spamming. Gun play feels just as good, my two main classes being Vanguard and Heavy, both play different and just feel amazing.

Overall, in its current state (9/05/2024) game is a solid 8/10. Has issues with connectivity and long load times (which I think are helped by turning crossplay off) and I believe the Anti-Cheat can cause some temp spiking if that matters to you.

Ryzen 7 3700X and a 2070 Super ran everything on high and DLSS on Quality at a smooth 1080p 60fps no problem. The only bug we have encountered so far have been infinite load times but that only happened twice in the entire play through. This game is also FILLED with cosmetics for customizing your online character for Ops/PvP which is a huge bonus for 40k fans if you have a favorite chapter. 8.75/10 so far!

The set dressing and attention to detail in the environments alone make this something truly special, and every level improves upon the last in this regard. It hearkens back to the glory days of 360-era games in the best way possible.

The AI squad members can sometimes let the gameplay down, and I had a few minor bugs here and there, but none of this ruined my experience, nor did they interrupt my enjoyment of the chaotic action happening around me at every corner. I'd say the weaker levels are at the beginning, and it scales from there.

It's a 10/10 Warhammer 40k game but for gameplay I would only rate it a 7/10.

It really looks amazing and the big battle scenes feel cool but there is a lot of little gameplay things that bother me. No hp regen, I spent the whole game on like 10% hp. You can recover little pips of armor but they go away so fast and sometimes you can't even avoid some damage. On higher difficulties the big enemies become damage sponges and it isn't fun hitting them 100 times before you can execute them.
The weapon balancing also feels off, it seems in campaign and pve everything is about the same strength so that no weapon is better, but that just feels bad because I can't one shot enemies with melta weapons or thunder hammer...

MechaDangerous,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MechaDangerous/,"The campaign is amazing. It captures the 40k universe amazingly well and really feels like you could be in the boots of an space marine. It feels good and has good weight to each action. The grittiness and darkness of this universe is shown so well.

The online is where the game falls off a lot. If you're hoping for some super engrossing PvP combat, look somewhere else:

There are two versions of online. Co-Op PvE, and PvP.

The co-op PvE is pretty good. I like how it's integrated with the main campaign, so that was a smart decision and feels like you're still seeing parts of the campaign even after you've finished it. Very cool way to do that. Unfortunately there are only 6 missions, but more are promised to be added via the season pass.

The PvP though, is where things start to get bad. It's obviously not a focus of the game, and feels very tacked on, but it's still a thing. If you're going into this game wanting to focus on PvP, I feel like you're going to be disappointed.

- Lack of maps. I think there are 3? 4? Hopefully more to come with the season pass.
- Lack of game modes. Standard team deathmatch, a mode with three points you try to control to earn points, and another mode with one point that rotates you have to control for points. That's it. Again, hopefully more to come with the season pass?
- Lack of balance. I'm not even sure how to approach this. Between bulwark's that are invincible due to their shield (there are ways around it, but come on, it's massively OP), and a class that stunlocks by grappling you, it gets frustrating fairly quickly.
- Corner-advantage. Look, I get it it's a 3rd person game, but it's really annoying to be killed around a corner by someone that I can't even see even though I'm looking in their direction. They can see me, but I can't see them.

All in all, definitely get the game for the campaign and play through that. It has a decent length, and each mission is pretty long. The PvE portions of this game are great. the PvP portions are not. For the PvE alone I'd say it's recommended, but maybe when it's on sale.",Recommended,1707,24.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

ianice92,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ianice92/,"In the Name of the Emperor: A Review of Warhammer 40k: Space Marines 2

Brothers in arms, heed my words. I, Brother Sergeant of the Valorous Chapter, bring you tidings of our latest endeavor in the grim darkness of the far future. The Imperium has forged a new instrument of war—Warhammer 40k: Space Marines 2. Prepare yourselves for a review worthy of the Emperor's finest.

Forge of Battle

The battlefield calls, and Space Marines 2 answers with unyielding strength. This game is no mere simulation; it is a crucible where your mettle as a Space Marine is tested against the unrelenting tides of xenos and heretic alike. The graphics are a testament to the Emperor’s glory, with visuals that render our power armor and wargear with such detail that even the most stoic of Techmarines would salute the developers.

Tactical Mastery

Strategic minds will find much to praise. The tactical depth of Space Marines 2 is unparalleled. Every engagement demands precision and cunning. The tactical pause feature allows you to command your squad with the foresight of a Chapter Master. Positioning, cover, and the use of terrain are critical. This is not a battlefield for the faint-hearted. Your decisions will echo through the annals of war, shaping the fate of your squad and the outcome of every skirmish.

The Armory Unleashed

Brothers, the arsenal at your disposal is both formidable and expansive. From the thunderous roar of the Lascannon to the cleansing flame of the Heavy Bolter, the weaponry is as varied as it is devastating. Each weapon feels unique, imbued with the power to smite the enemies of the Imperium. The customization options allow you to fine-tune your loadout, ensuring that your squad is ready to face any foe with the Emperor’s righteous fury.

The Enemy’s Onslaught

The xenos and heretics you face are not to be underestimated. The AI has been honed to present a challenging adversary, capable of adapting to your strategies. It is a worthy foe, ensuring that every battle remains hard-fought and demanding. Whether facing the ravenous Orks or the insidious Chaos forces, you will find that the enemies you encounter are as relentless as the darkness itself.

The Emperor’s Blessing

Warhammer 40k: Space Marines 2 is not without its flaws. There are moments when the game’s relentless pace can become overwhelming, and the need for a stable connection for certain features can be a hindrance. However, these are but minor blemishes on an otherwise exemplary testament to the Emperor’s glory.

In Conclusion

Space Marines 2 stands as a shining example of what it means to wage war in the 41st Millennium. It is a game that captures the spirit of the Adeptus Astartes—unyielding, valiant, and ever-ready to confront the darkness. For those who seek to prove their worth in the Emperor’s name, this game is a worthy trial by fire.

Prepare your bolters, steel your resolve, and march forth, Brothers. The Imperium needs you, and Space Marines 2 stands ready to test your valor in the fires of battle. For the Emperor!

I've never been a 40k fan because the lore is just too deep for me to get invested, this is my first time to actually invested time in the franchise, and it was very enjoyable!

My one gripe right now is that i cannot use steam controller support, so my back paddles on the elite 2 controller dont work, have to disable steam controller support to play on a pad. Other than that ( i do hope its fixed at some point) this game is a solid 9/10

Thank you Saber Interactive, for reminding me what fun games can be.

Visually it is a spectacle, technical sector faithful to the 40K universe and truly fantastic in cooperative, the game does not end with the campaign and puts into play operations in Coop and a competitive PvP multiplayer.
Aspects to improve are the few maps present at launch both for operations and especially for PvP, 3 arenas are a bit few.
Progression system a bit cumbersome and slow, forces long grinding sessions.

Visuals and environments (including what is happening in the background) is just a masterpiece.
Audio is good but music is a bit of underwhelming.
Gameplay is very fun. You can 'feel' the shooting to all enemies. Classes give a good variety for combat tactics.
Objectives in missions are fine, nothing special but nothing boring too.
I think plot is not the main thing of this game but is quite interesting and the characters are not dull at all with their stories (which you can discover through their ongoing interactions throughout missions).
The world warhammer 40k is immensely well and fantastically portrayed.

The game could use some more enemy variety and perhaps weapon diversity.
Some bugs to workaround, for example problems with loading some textures and waiting long for quitting the game.
A bit too much grind for my taste to unlock skins for armour.

silentdan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/silentdan/,"Do you remember when early CoD (MW, MW2, I think maybe the first Black Ops) and Gears of War and Battlefield were games where everything was just 10/10 epic all the time? That's back now. You can have that feeling again, and oh, by the way, all of the single-player content can be played co-op.

Success in combat hinges on balancing offence and defence. Parries and dodges are important for self-preservation, but doing them well opens the enemy up to a high-damage counterattack. Non-boss enemies have a drone/master relationship, with the drones trying to swarm you. It's difficult to attack the swarm directly, but killing the elite that controls them will cause them to either die or turn on each other, so target selection matters. There are no cover mechanics to speak of. You have to charge in and get your hands dirty.

The weaponry selection allows for a lot of flexibility. Chainswords, power swords, combat knives, and thunderhammers all have different combos, and different trade-offs for high single-target damage vs area damage. Ranged weapons aren't really the focus, but they also balance range against power and area, with analogs to sniper rifles (Stalker bolter), machine guns (heavy boltgun), shotguns (melta rifle) and sometimes flamethrowers.

Space Marine 2 is one of those games where you can die embarrassingly, think this might be beyond your abilities, and then come right back and blaze through it like an invincible avenging angel. It'll punish mistakes quickly and harshly, but when you're in that flow state, catching leaping minoris by the tail and smashing them into the ground, parrying three Lictor attacks, and following up with a headshot and gory chainsword fatality, it's just the absolute pinnacle of the 3PS experience.

Despite the story being on the shorter side it was peak all the way through. The writing is very good and the cutscenes are some of the best I've seen. Plus there is more to do outside the story with PvE missions and the PvP.

The overall gameplay in this game is very fun and engaging. The parry system is very satisfying and just fighting the hordes of enemies overall is very fun. I feel all of my hits having impact on the enemies which just makes it very pleasing combat wise. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE EXECUTIONS, they are true peak.

Saber has transported me back to the first decade of the 2000s when video games were just art and pure entertainment. For sure this is not a perfect game, but it is certainly a great one. A solid campaign, cooperative mode and a multiplayer mode, which is simple, but very fun and entertaining, with a progression system and lots of rewards to unlock for free. Just like in the good ol' days.
How good it feels to be able to play a video game with no developer-generated fomo to encourage battle passes sales, with a clear roadmap before release, no microtransactions and no in-game store.
Space Marine 2 is visually amazing with stunning graphics, the combat system is smooth and action packed with a blood and gore feast. I'm playing it on a 3080 with no problems or bugs so far, but I think they can optimize the game even more for my fellow brothers who don't own a beefy GPU.

DefinitelyNotAdrian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DefinitelyNotAdrian/,"Imagine you threw together gears of war and helldivers.

Space marine 2 evokes a lot of xbox 360 era shooters in control scheme and moment to moment gameplay. The campaign, while only 6 missions, spans about 12 hours on easiest difficulty, assuming you never die. My single player run took around 15-17 hours on 3rd hardest difficulty.

The co-op campaign really shines with a lot of customization options, progression for your chosen marine build, and fun ways to mix and match squad perks and specializations. You really have to think about your team composition on hardest i.e. ""We need a tank"" ""we need someone with heavy single-target weaponry."" ""We need a horde clearer."".

PVP is pretty bog standard. There's king of the hill mode, a king of the hill-adjacent mode, and deathmatch. That's it. The classes and variety make up for the shortage of modes but if you bring to mind gears of war's pvp mode, it's exactly the same. The camera and physics and deathcam even make it feel like gears of war.

There's a roadmap out including a ton of cosmetic options, a drip of new enemies and weapons and gamemodes, which are great.

The campaign story is also some excellent sci-fi fare that really ramped up around halfway through, and some very badass cinematics and set pieces. The final mission on demerium especially stands out with some ""didn't expect that."" moments.

And for 40k fans, this is 100% pure fanservice. Everything from lore to character details to sound design is just awesome.

TheCharredKnight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCharredKnight/,"I may be biased being that the first space marine game made up a lot of my childhood onward unto adulthood, I love this game a lot. there is some polish needed in regards to some glitches here and there which can make the game a bit painful and hell some glitches being fun like the scope being taken off the bolt rifle hearkening back to the og bolter which is one that makes me happy but i digress. The game is visceral, Can be challenging if you want that especially on ruthless and a lot of fun, i'm hooked for now unless another 40k game comes round the corner

This game i wanted for so long felt like lost hope but am happy to see it come true. my only desires from this game now are niche but would love to see a mark 6 (beakie/corvus pattern helm) or the mark 7 helm which currently has one on the veteran set for primaris, admittedly i still love firstborn a lot. Armour model customisation for chaos too would be nice. Armour variation in general would be nice

more maps and gamemodes would be wonderful even a war mode as the gameplay would be interesting maybe bring some vets in from the eternal crusade days

other then that modding would increase the longevity of this game into the decades much like how the og space marine had it's own. while i may not have hope for that, mesh replacer mods from the community would be fun to see, client side btw

other then that i have a lot of love for this game as i did for the original, so far and honestly it's been a joy to play so far with friends and by myself, all i can hope for now is just more content added onto this game aswell as polish to make the game reach greater heights.",Recommended,1332,112.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

76561198001130820,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001130820/,"So, firstly this game is a breath of fresh air, 13 years was worth the wait since the first game. The world-building and lore is on point, the mechanics are familiar yet improved and this game really puts you in the world of the grim dark future and the dev's really did their homework.

Further in a world (our world) where every game needs a unicorn character, the game drips with masculinity and is a reminder of what we've lost in gaming over the last decade or so. (Interestingly none of the developer staff are from the western world) so maybe thats something? But yeah a breath of fresh air when every game recently feels the need to make political points about the real world rather than just focusing on the game.

The graphics are amazing, the storyline is really good and a nice development on the first one. No spoilers but it skips 100 years and with the 13 year gap we kinda feel like we've been serving penance with Titus so that fits nicely.

The 'endgame' multiplayer system works kinda similar to WWZ on the PVE side, and the same as the first SM on pvp side. Sadly there is no endless defence/holdout (yet) like there was in the first game.

This brings me to the only negative thing I can say about SM2, and that is that the endgame content is very limited... 6 co-op missions and 4/5 PvP maps is going to feel stale very quickly, and I worry if they dont add content quite quickly, that this game will dry up much like SM1 did once everyone had the skins they wanted.

I give it a 7/10 for now, well worth buying and playing, especially if you're a 40k fan. However the endgame content does drag this score down form a 9/10.",Recommended,1344,22.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

76561198267034142,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198267034142/,"The Story is honestly really fun and probably the best part about the game currently. It has Co-op for 2 more players and is overall written well and feels good to play. Even playing alone is fun because the squad AI is surprisingly good.

Combat feels really good if not a little clunky at times. You feel powerful in the campaign and in PvE on recommended difficulties. Combat in PvP is a mixed bag due to class counters and some imbalance.

PvE classes are unique and very flexible in terms of skills and is very fun with friends and even randoms. Right now you can only play Loyalist PvE which is somewhat disappointing since they have the Chaos models and voice lines in PvP.

PvP needs some serious balancing since right now it feels like you either get stomped or you do the stomping with no in between.

Customization is fun as long as you are a loyalist Space Marine even though it could use a few more chapter emblems (please give me Son's of the Phoenix emblems I am begging you). Chaos needs its own major update for cosmetics because right now its just color swaps.

Only major deal breaker is that the servers these guys use to host online games are the literally the worst. Ping right now will always be high no matter how good your WiFi is and its not rare to drop from a game. The Season Pass also does not work/isn't what you think it is. You don't seem to unlock anything right now besides one skin that isn't editable for the Heavy Class in PvE.

Once everything is fixed with more content added: 9/10
Right now Overall: 7/10 due to server issues for multiplayer
PvE: 7/10 has major potential but needs better servers and more content
PvP: 8/10 if you either have friends or are really good otherwise its closer to a 6/10 due to imbalance

You are Titus, but who’s Titus, really? A hero? A pawn? A construct of war?! Doesn’t matter—the moment you grip that chainsword, the galaxy whispers, then screams.

The Tyranids crawl—oh god, they crawl! Everywhere, like ants in your brain, gnawing at sanity. I swear, I heard one in my room last night. The combat’s so real it reaches out, grabs you by the throat—are you playing the game or is the game playing you? Endless slashes, endless roars, and then the bolter, the gunfire in rhythm with your heartbeat. BOOM BOOM BOOM! It's not just the controller vibrating, it's your soul shaking apart.

The world is too large, but too small. Why does it feel so big, but I can’t move far? Walls, invisible, but I know they're there, I can feel them breathing down my neck. Titus talks, but did I hear him say something else just now? “For the Emperor,” he says, but sometimes I hear “Run.”

There’s beauty in it too, in the destruction, in the chaos... but that beauty is suffocating, it traps you, makes you want more. One more Tyranid. One more battle. Just one more... Until you forget how long you’ve been in the war. Hours? Days? Did I sleep last night?

Space Marine 2 is loud, violent, a fever dream of warhammer glory... or maybe it's just a trap, pulling us deeper into the madness, into the abyss. Are we Titus? Are we lost? I don’t know.

The operation pve mode however is very fun even with only having 6 missions, however more are gonna be added in a FREE update (looks over to payday). The pvp is alright but it does have a older school shooter pvp feel to it, kinda like halo/gears, so if you like that kind of stuff i can see people enjoying that mode, and with enough of a playerbase who knows maybe they will flesh out that mode more aswell. Defiantly worth the 60$ and if you are a coop pve enjoyer like me between Space Marine/Darktide updates we will be eating good in the 40k universe.


I do however have a few qol things id like to see get added, mostly pretaining to operations mode since that is what I have mostly played.

1st: Loadouts should be able to have different perks equipped. Right now you character/weapon perks will be the same across all loadouts so if you want to try different things out you have to switch the perks out everytime.

2nd: allow us to delete armor/paint setups, its really weird this isnt a thing.

3rd: have a button or a setting toggle that explains what things do more specifically, for example the tactical ability marks enemies and makes them ""vulnerable"" would be nice to know just how vulnerable things are.

Lastly while playing with the lazer sniper a lot there are a lot of railings/scenery that blocks my shots (especially when they go into the execute threshold) when they should be clear, idk if this is actually fixable but would be nice.",Recommended,1370,35.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

9/10 game for sure.

This review is based solely on the PvE mode since I haven't played campaign or PvP yet.

Super crisp gameplay, haven't experienced any bugs so far. Joining issues and one crash but it's to be expected with a huge playercount.
Gameplay is top-notch and very skill-based. The difference between a bad player and a very good player is incredibly noticable even at the lowest difficulty and personally I think that's exactly how it should be.
Customization is awesome. Diverse classes. Progression is really good. You're able to level weapons that are shared between classes so you can bring your endgame weapon that you leveled on one class onto another completely fresh level 1 class.
Heavy focus on teamplay both in gameplay and in spirit, having to share resources with your team instead of being greedy.
Transparent devs with an established roadmap and an open forum for suggestions that, given enough upvotes, the devs actually look at and consider. Plenty of stabilization updates now in the first week of launch. It bodes well for the future of the game..

Downsides - Not a lot tbh. Server issues, having to migrate host completely at random while in the middle of a match which takes up to a minute or two, the guns not being as impactful as they would be in established lore like having to empty an entire Bolter magazine into a Tyranid Warrior even to just get him into execution state. Most of the complaints I have are about the customization.
Very limited customization for the chaos space marines in PvP mode. Although I don't share this opinion, I've heard it from multiple sources that the core gameplay of both campaign and PvE is kind of one-dimensional.
Customization for loyalist Marines leaves a lot to be desired if you're coming from the tabletop or if you're a real lore-enthusiast. Left and right pauldron have different specific emblems, knee pad emblems are very limited, colors are very restricted and designated between primary, secondary and tertiary colors so you can't have any color you want on any part of your gear. You're restricted to certain colors on primary gear, certain colors as secondary and certain colors (mostly metal) as tertiary colors. You cannot have a head with a green wreath and a golden skull, for example. They're both gonna be one color. You cannot have a white shoulder trim with golden adornments, they're both one color. Small things like this is really important when it comes to chapter heraldry and Space Marine identity, but in the grand scale of things it doesn't diminish the quality of the game. It's simply an issue for people who want to follow the established Space Marine lore.

All in all; If you're a Warhammer 40k (and specifically Space Marine) fan then this game is DEFINITELY for you.
This game lives and dies on it's PvE mode. The devs have promised to expand on this through adding more missions (there are currently 6), a horde mode and more to come. I feel hopeful about the future of this game.
If you're just looking to turn your brain off and play some campaign for 10-12 hours then the price tag is probably not worth it. The fact you can play campaign in 3 player co-op is great though, and the campaign will surely leave you wanting for more, causing you to jump into the PvE mode with your own customized Space Marine.

The game has a decent story (singleplayer or co-op) mode, good (co-op) operations and a PVP mode (which is surprisingly good) but the game at launch is missing simple modes like a survival/horde mode which feels like a no brainer for this sort of game so I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed that it's missing (among other things..)

It also has some design problems in my opinion when it comes to the shield regenerator ""execute enemy"" system as it makes you compete with your own team mates in co-op about getting health back (if you played it you know what I'm talking about) which doesn't feel intended (but a lot more like a design flaw in the combat and health system)

The 6 operations you replay over and over again at launch are not enough.

So to keep it (somewhat) short.. As of right now (with the launch content) I'd give it a solid 7.5/10 but it can and likely will easily go up to a 8 or even a 9 with future content.

Please find the TLDR at the bottom if you do not wish to read everything.

From the very first mission, Space Marine 2 does an excellent job of capturing the essence of 40k. You instantly feel like a powerful Space Marine, battling through waves of Tyranids with a mix of heavy weaponry and brutal melee attacks. The controls feel responsive and tight, whether you’re unleashing bolter rounds into enemies or slicing through them with a chainsword. The combat is fluid and satisfying, and the game is well optimised, considering the chaos that can be going on at once.

Campaign Highlights

The campaign offers about 7-8 hours of intense, action-packed gameplay. The story keeps you engaged without feeling too long or repetitive. If you're new to the 40k universe, the game does a good job explaining the basics of the lore, so you don’t need to be intimidated. For longtime fans, the game remains faithful to the lore, providing a deeper connection to the characters and setting. It’s a story that’s easy to follow but engaging enough to keep you invested throughout.

Multiplayer Potential (PvP)

As for multiplayer, if you're coming in expecting loads of content right away, you might be a little underwhelmed. Currently, there are only three game modes and three maps, which doesn’t offer a huge amount of variety. However, what is there is extremely fun and addictive. The gameplay feels fast-paced and dynamic. Although the content is limited, the core mechanics are solid, and there’s a lot of potential for future updates and expansions. If the developers build on this strong foundation, multiplayer could really shine in the long term.

Multiplayer Potential (PvE) (Limited playtime personally)

PvE is just as limited, offering as of time of writing only 6 operations but it too stands as a solid foundation for the devs to build off and has so much potential to but one of the games defining reasons for people to want to buy the game.

Final Recommendation

Space Marine 2 is an easy recommendation if you're looking for a game that balances action and accessibility. Whether you’re a seasoned 40k fan or completely new to the series, the game offers something for everyone. The campaign is entertaining and well-paced, while the multiplayer, though currently light on content, is fun and addicting with room for growth. If you're considering picking it up, I'd say go for it it’s a blast to play.

TLDR

Space Marine 2 is a fast-paced, fun game that nails the feeling of being a Space Marine in the 40k universe. The campaign is engaging and runs about 7-8 hours, with great combat mechanics. Multiplayer is limited in content right now, but what’s there is a lot of fun. Whether you’re new to 40k or a veteran, it’s worth picking up!",Recommended,2420,119.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

Haven't tried PVP but from what i can tell the ttk is in a nice spot and can add some more life to the game. If the Devs can keep a steady stream of content then i can see this game doing really well. If not, for those who seek a more PVE style of game play, they might burn out pretty quick due to the repetitious nature of the multiplayer operations, even though the enemies are procedural (kinda), the mission objectives can get a little stale. However, the progression system and different classes help for those who seek to grind like i do, i can see myself easily putting 100+ hours chasing those levels and gear.

fishstick,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fishstick/,"Tentative recommendation.

There's a lot of good here, but there are a couple of major flaws that really sour much of the experience on higher difficulties. Some of these on their own are not terrible, but the combination of them can cause some serious frustration.

TLDR: Play the Campaign on Normal, with other humans, for the best experience. The current state of AI teammates is abysmal, and balance scaling on Veteran+ is difficult, but not in a fun way.


Long version:

First of all, do not make the mistake of starting the campaign on Veteran. Your AI Teammates in the Campaign are absolutely useless for anything other than reviving you. For some reason on difficulties higher than Normal they rarely use their abilities, and would rather spend several minutes shooting at one termagaunt while you juggle multiple warriors.

That doesnt sound too bad until you start hitting campaign missions that REALLY feel like they were designed for human players - where one person has to activate an objective and the rest covers. Only the AI will never do these objectives, and they certainly won't cover you. Gotta shoot enemies off of an objective, well they don't do that either.

This would also not be a huge problem if some enemies focusing you basically reduce your own DPS to zero if you want to not die - Zoanthropes for example shoot series of balls/beams that will either hurt you a lot, or knock you down over and over, unless you dodge constantly and hope your teammates are shooting the Z (spoiler; if they're AI: they're not.).
On top of this, ranged enemies will target the player almost exclusively. 2 of your AI Bros can be punching a ranged Warrior in the face but it will still spend every chance it can trying to snipe you across the yard.

Once you play with other human players it all comes together much better, but bumping difficulty up starts showing some other flaws. Enemies become bullet sponges, where even chaff enemies like gaunts take multiple combos from heavy weapons and Majoris enemies take multiple stalker mags to the face.

On higher difficulties it quickly becomes a game of dodge back and heavy forward as you very conservatively take on enemies in what feels more like you're playin Dark Souls 40K rather than a Space Marine game, as even chaff enemies' ranged fire wil quickly strip your armor to nothing as soon as you get it back from an execution. Unlike SM1 where chaff enemies are health bags, this is not the case in SM2 as melee kills don't restore (non-white) health unless you have specific abilities going.",Recommended,2127,16.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

hatchetboy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hatchetboy/,"tl:dr: This is a really good game.

I've now completed the campaign and played a little online PVE and PVP. It's an amazing dive back into the franchise and a great intro to the WH 40k lore.

There are one or two glitches, and a couple of early access crashes. The game won't cleanly close down for me for some reason, but the gameplay is solid and I'm fairly sure the minor issues will be fixed (mostly around slight mistiing of the parry/dodge cues and grenades sometimes not working). The writing is solid if a little unspectacular and standard GW cliched, the twist at the end is hugely telegraphed and you don't really miss out on a lot if you didn't play SM1 (though you should, it's great).

WWZ is a better game and has 20-30 (like 4-6x) missions depending on your dlc. and those missions _were_ the campaign and great story. L4D2 should be the model for co-op as we all know.

so preliminary review is that space marine 2 = fatass walking simulator. walk your fat ass to a ship. walk your fat ass to various brothers because lawd knows those fat ♥♥♥♥♥ can't walk their genetically modified lard asses to you or call you on comms. pressing lshift to sprint is basically saying ""you feel marginally faster because gravity (on whatever planet in 40k) combined with fatness makes your inertia seem mighty."" loading times are also so fat that we should probably load windows xp and get a 3dfx glide card to make the game go faster.

Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


Pro: A Treat for Warhammer 40k Nerds
If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cons: Not Worth the Price if You're Not a 40k Geek
However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",Recommended,2249,39.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

76561198206328681,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198206328681/,"Got a rig that barely meets the minimum requirements, but it still runs pretty smooth and well on custom settings between low and medium. The optimalization is really good, didn't expect this in early access.

The campaign is shorter, but intense, action packed and full of action, lore and many nods and easter eggs. It is clear that the devs made it with lot of love and passion for the Warhammer, with every single detail. The combat is simmilar to first game, but improved and more smooth, while giving you the amazing feel of what it is to be an Astartes, without making it weird or unbalanced.

Co-op operations are interesting and sometimes even more intense. And nicely tied to the main storyline. With more to come in the future, I am curious as how will the devs approach it, but after what I had the chance to see and play, I have full faith in them.

Didn't play much of PvP yet, so can't talk about the balance, but I feel like the customization of marine is lacking (which applies also for the operations).

For Adeptus Astartes, the customization options of armor and weapons is incredible. But each class has predefined look of the marine's face. Meaning that if you want to play without helmet or play class where skin is visible and you make for example a Salamander or White Scar, you don't play ashen skinned or Mongol marine, but still the default one. I really hope this will be changed in the future and more options will be offered. Same for Chaos Marines where the customization options are even more limited.

But this is the only criticism I can offer for this game. Other then that, it is worthy successor to the first game and amazing gift and love letter to Warhammer 40k fans.

If you're a Warhammer fan, this is a must buy. If you're a fan of the idea of a 3rd person DOOM style experience with over the top executions and a fun selection of melee and ranged weapons, then this is a must buy.

I've been waiting for this game for 10 years and it has largely delivered, but I do have a few gripes.

Gripe 1: Annoying bugs (not the enemies in game). In a 4 hour session, my friends and I managed to bug an encounter that would force us to reload last checkpoint at least 5 times. Luckily the checkpoints are rather frequent so we didn't get set far back, but still annoying.

Gripe 2: No camera position or FOV controls. I just wish I could pan the camera back even just a little bit. Titus is a massive space marine and takes up a rather significant portion of the screen. I get the armor is detailed and all, but I want to see the enemies coming at me before they're in my teeth. Being able to back the camera up would be so nice. Also don't remember seeing a setting to change the position of the camera from right shoulder to left or in my preference, middle.

Gripe 3: The bolter's sound design is lackluster. They sound like they pack a punch, don't get me wrong. But it does not sound like I'm firing a gun that's launching .998 caliber mass reactive shells. Darktide did the bolter's chunky sound far better justice.",Recommended,1183,15.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

Aside from that, the game isn't buggy haven't seen any game breaking stuff.

Story wise, the game highlights each factions best points from the lore's and novels. My one gripe is just how textbook the chaos antagonist is and how short we fought the tyranids, would've loved to see more of them since they are the biggest threat in the current setting.

The main antagonists are not very talkative which only made me wish we fought khorne's faction instead or even orcs since they are alot more comical and much more entertaining. I'm currently hoping that the new enemies in season 3 & 4 are the talkative bunch like orcs or khorne.

Side note, the guardsmen are pretty badass and would love to see more of them in new missions, if not maybe different space marine chapters like imperial fists or black templars.

Overall, the game is good fun, holding the line be it with your battle brothers or with the cadians makes your adrenaline run. But the lack of dialogue between the opposing factions kinda dulls the experience a bit.",Recommended,953,40.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

Or don't. Because a lot of faithful servants to the Emperor had to pray to the Machine Spirist, relighting their incenses when the game crashed on Intel due to the cooling not being able to handle the on-startup-boost temperatures. That's something to be worked on.

Other than that, the game is great. Let's be honest, the campaign missions are dull just like the story, they really only serve as a frame to get you from one encounter to another, but oh boy, did it ever feel so good to crush and stomp Tyranid hordes as a Space Marine? Nothing comes close. A true Adeptus Astartes power fantasy. This is what the game is. Nothing more, nothing less. Is it repetitive? Yes. Is the mission design dull (for it is an always online, potentionally 3-man coop game so it expects you to assemble at gauntlets which taints any suprise)? Yes. Is it a ton of fun? Yes. Definitely.

If you did not enjoy Space Marine (1), you won't like this. If you did, you will. As simple as that.

Juicemang,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Juicemang/,"It's hard for me to put into words how faithful this game is to the source material. Every inch of it is straight out of 40k novels and codexes. The dialogue, the various groups you encounter, the aesthetic, the sound design, the tone, everything. It absolutely blew me away the level of detail that went into this game to faithfully recreate the world of Warhammer 40k. It was everything I could have asked for after waiting 13 years for the sequel, and more.

The only things I think could be improved upon was the combat when it comes to fighting swarms of enemies and some of the mission designs were clearly made with co-op in mind. Melee combat works well when you're fighting up to small groups of enemies, but when there's 15 or 20, or more, you're quickly surrounded and your armor and health drop fast. At least it did on the 3rd hardest difficulty, which the game advertises as the intended experience. The original Space Marine got around this by allowing you to replenish all your health using executes, but in Space Marine 2 it's merely one bar of armor; and that lasts about half a second when you're in the thick of it. I'm by no means the best player, but I'm good enough to recognize how punishing this new system is. Combine that with some missions clearly meant for you to perform objectives while a friend or two covers your back, and it can get a little difficult.

All in all, though, this game is an absolute love letter to every fan out there and was well worth the wait. I just hope it doesn't take more than a decade for the next one.",Recommended,1276,83.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

Yuilhan818,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuilhan818/,"As a fan of the 40k universe and Table top game since early 2000 this was Literally everything I had hoped it would be. The campaign was EPIC on the scale that you always imagined it would be like if you were a part of the action while shuffling you carefully painted and assembled minis around your home made terrain peices.

I don't know how to adequately express that the authenticy and care taken to make this game really represent in a well played out narrative the immensity of the lore, scale of the structures, Massiveness of the armies and forces, the unique technologies and everything that makes 40k a masterwork of world building, really shines through even just playing through campaign. The battles feel intense, the sound design is amazing, graphically it is stunning from character and creature models to terrain, vehicles, architecture, and setpeices.

I entirely get it there are some graphical glitches now and again and if i had a gamplay gripe it would be that the combat is a little clunky especially melee (but honestly the marines are pretty clunky....), although the Satisfying feel of firing the bolters and other weapons really covered for a lot. I'm sure as I continue to grind levels on Operations I'll be more upset about some of the technicals...but just purely as a 40K Space Marine fan I couldn't have enjoyed the campaign much more than I did.

PvP is challenging and fun the Level grind Is going to be my next goal I'm not that big of a PvP player so I'm less concerned about it but it would be neat if that ended up being a strong feature too.

Highly recommended in general, Must have if you love the 40K Universe.

I'm sorry I'm not nitpicking like I'm sure there's plenty of reviews doing. But This is by FAR the best 40k Game I've played and I've played a LOT since Dawn of War 1 in 2004....

Considering the number of patches games normally need before they have a mediocrely servicable product I feel like the Release of SM2 was above average in how well it performs technically on opening day (well 4 days before I got the early release version) compared to other new releases I have purchased, which I don't do often SpaceMarine 2 was an exception and I regret nothing.

lankspank,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lankspank/,"First thoughts as someone who's never really played any Warhammer or 40K games (other than Vermintide 2).

This game really takes me back to the feeling of the Xbox 360 era of gaming. Good, simple fun. For $60, this game doesn't just focus on one aspect to perfection but does multiple things very well. Kind of like Halo and Gears of War vibes.

Campaign: You get a solid campaign that can be played co-op or solo. The voice acting and characters are very interesting. The atmosphere and world are a lot to take in and can be breathtaking at some moments. They put a lot of polish in the design. 

PVE: Missions mode, where you can team up and play different classes to further unlock new weapons, armor, and mastery/bonuses for the weapons. 

PVP: I haven't played enough to think it could get in depth enough to be someone's main staple for a shooter, but it is a fun addition to the game that doesn't seem to take itself too seriously but knows what it wants to be at the same time. 

I was worried when I saw a season pass that had a lot of cosmetics at first, but I don't mind paid content being cosmetic only; that is fine; I just don't like when those are the ONLY cosmetics in this game. I can safely say though that this game once again goes back to the Xbox 360 era, where there are a lot of different customization options that you can grind for and earn in the game that aren't locked behind a season/battle pass. That was one of my favorite things about Halo 3: earning your armor. 

Overall, I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10 so far. Once the road map and content become more fleshed out over time, it will have a lot to offer. I think it is a good complete $60 game, though. And for all the Helldivers 2 comparisons or people wondering if it's similar, I wouldn't say too much. It is 3rd person and lots of gunfights/hordes of enemies, but that's about where it ends. The game is a lot more serious and not goofy at all. So don't come into this game thinking it's a better Helldivers 2 or replacement for you if you are upset about Helldivers recent changes. Both games do things differently and have two different vibes.",Recommended,1744,11.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

Campaign is basically what I wanted from a sequel to Space Marine 1 but it exceeded my expectations, offers one of the most epic and cinematic experiences I ve had in gaming and especially in 40k sense, meticulously crafted with detail, you could have read about these stories in 40k books but to feel it on this lvl is something else entirely

If you dont like the gameplay loop, dont bother as its one of the main factors that makes the game enjoyable, you feel like a space marine, visceral and chonky combat with power fantasy

it expands in pve with various perks but as pve is connected to the main story, it remains to be epic and still fun to do with unique missions and things to strive and grind for

pvp is quite fun due to the gameplay loop, reminds you of Halo times of quick and easy pvp, fast rounds, fast kills

those modes do need more love with balancing, more content and features but already some good indicators

now if the modes do not appeal to you as well as the gameplay loop, it wont be worth for you

and as a bonus for warhammer fans the customisation looks incredible, it looks like i am actually painting minis without investing 10k (ofc it wont replace the whole thing) but damn its the best visual 40k fashion fest you could possibly find in gaming, cant wait for more chapter sets, cant say enough how much i love looking at the variously customised and painted models

game is not perfect, it has a few things to work on to reach that goty, but an easy recommend from me, loving it for what it already has, might be goty for me in the end of the year in terms of feelings it invokes while i am playing it and how much i appreciate some of the things it did

The combat can be a little bit difficult to pick up, but once it clicks it's easily one of the most fun systems that I have experienced. It was a rather good breath of fresh air with the lack of fun that I've had with Helldivers 2 at the time of release. The guns feel weighty and good, and the melee is a larger focus than I had expected. The story is somewhat predictable and simple, but by no means bad. The co-op happens alongside the main story and is easily the most fun that the game offers. The PVP is somewhat barebones but it fills it's role well enough to be enjoyable.

Overall I would rate this game a solid 9/10. There are very few complaints that I have, and even then they aren't all that crazy. Would highly recommend.",Recommended,794,46.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

What is there is truely excellent and if you're looking for a satisfying feeling, power fantasy that offers up a surprising amount of difficulty, this is exactly for you.
The only disappointment so far (27 hours in) has been how the content does seem to run a bit dry sooner than expected. I expected the game to have a similar lasting power as Left 4 Dead games, that offered short ""Campaigns"", yet it was just fun even repeating the same levels.
The problem the ""Operations"" PvE missions seem to face, is that there is no real reason to scour through the corners of the map very well in hopes for something cool or different. Yes, health pickups and the like are valuable, but they don't change the game in ways that different weapon pickups, adrenaline shots, chainsaws, gas canisters, defibrillators etc. seemed to change things up in L4D.

The different grenades offer a tiny bit of variation and so do the somewhat randomized enemy encounters, but that's about it in terms of variety. Even the most valuable things, the Armory Data is always(?) in the same spots.

With that said, the gameplay loop itself is ridiculously fun and trying to tackle new difficulty levels has been exciting and I don't see myself dropping the game any time soon. But it has left me wishing there was more to discover, rare armor piece finds or.. just a little bit more intrique to level exploration itself.

Right now it seems there's a ""meta"" building up that some players only dodgeroll through the level to the objective areas, skipping fighting anything that isn't necessary and I'd say that's a big indication of the levels not being interesting.

I don't regret a fully priced purchase however (bought the standard edition, with no season pass and other stuff) and have had a truely fun time with an action game that has me admittedly a little bit addicted.

Glad that the devs will be adding things in gradually. :) Hopefully it's concrete enough to offer variety once things start getting too repetitive.",Recommended,1777,35.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

If you're interested in exploring Warhammer, you should get this game

I had a lot of fun with Space Marine 2. The visuals are phenomenal, and it's clear that much effort went into making all models, from the space marines to Tyranids to Thousand Sons, look like animated versions of their tabletop models. The gameplay loop of transitioning between ranged and melee combat takes some getting used to if you, like me, haven't played many other third person shooters. I played the prequel many years ago, but don't remember much. If you're a big fan of games like Gears of War, perhaps the gameplay loop will feel more familiar. The combat is solid - when it works, it feels outstanding. This is especially true in the boss fights, which generally feel fluid and dynamic. When it doesn't work, however, gameplay can feel very frustrating. You might lose your entire health bar very quickly to ranged enemies or get swamped by a horde of hormagaunts or tzaangors, and it won't feel like there was much counterplay. This game is best experienced in a squad with other human players. The AI squadmates are... ok, but it feels like the developers gave them a large heathbar to compensate for the fact that they're really sluggish and don't really do much. When playing solo, you might get swamped by enemies that your squadmates should have easily dealt with, and from my experience this doesn't happen anywhere near as often when playing with human teammates. The story is quite short but it's tight. The missions feel well-structured, and if you want more there's a plethora of activities to do once you finish the main campaign. Overall, this game is quality over quantity. I hope the season pass DLC brings more PVE missions that include other factions from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, such as other xenos races and other chaos gods.",Recommended,1631,19.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

Honestly fantastic game that was worth the wait.

The game is visually fantastic and the level design is breath taking. Massive backgrounds while going through a linear level with huge battles going on. Genuinely amazing.

Story was great with quite a twist at the end that feels like it's going to lead into some DLC.

The customization is pretty great! Being able to customize your Space Marine while being in a known chapter or/also creating your very own chapter makes it incredibly solid.

Multiplayer is genuinely fun. There's no limit to the class you play. Can't wait to see what more they plan to add to it.

Now for the only negativity I have for this game. The Operations. They're alright, it's simply another campaign that goes along with the main campaign and adds some context here and there and it's pretty fun. If you're into immersion though and think you're your own space marine, tough luck. You're still seen as an Ultramarine. The actual main downside with Operations in my opinion is locking classes if a player has chosen it first. I see no reason to do this when other games like Darktide allow it. I get that these classes are apparently actual characters in the Ultramarine chapter, but it's such an irritating block. You'll have two brothers who want to be the same class and neither of them wish to change, forcing a third player to just stand and wait until one decides to finally leave the lobby. It's infuriating.

It's an amazing game that brings a huge win for the Warhammer 40,000 franchise and I really hope it has a good life with future content. I'm incredibly looking forward to the horde mode.",Recommended,1377,97.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

angry_crusader,https://steamcommunity.com/id/angry_crusader/,"After 13 long years we finally got a sequel to the ultimate Space Marine experience and boy oh boooy it was worth the wait! Space Marine 2 is a solid, no-nonsense, old school TPS / hack'n'slash action game. It just simply feels good.

The good:

+ Gorgeous graphics. Character/creature models look great, levels look astoundingly well made (especially the skyboxes and backdrops). They have truly nailed the Warhammer aesthetic.
+ Fantastic sound design. You can feel the weight of a Space Marine on the move, the kick of a heavy bolter, the crunchy and gruesome sounds when you're ripping a Tyranid apart. Eargasm stuff.
+ Combat feels tight and flows really well. Seamlessly switching between shooting and melee, simple and easy to execute combos (Take notes Game Science!). Doom Eternal style executions. Nothing groundbreaking or innovative about the combat, nevertheless it's still pretty satisfying.

The bad:
To be honest I don't have anything bad to say about the game, only some nitpicks.

- As of right now the Operations mode (PvE co-op) is pretty barebones and doesn't have a lot of replay value besides small stat upgrades and skins.
- Multiplayer feels super unbalanced. Matchmaking throws you in with players that are already max level so you just get steamrolled.
- Minor bugs during the campaign.

Technically these are cons yes, but I'm writing this review based on my experience during early access, and the game officially released just a few hours ago. All of the issues I wrote above will be fixed and more content will be added (hopefully enough to flesh out the Operations even further) in the coming months.

I really wish they could of indulged more in those big epic moments and made them longer even if only by a minute or two, especially towards the second half, I'm not really talking about gameplay as much but the actual story beats.
The loading screens also kill the pacing in really epic moments and cut scenes.

76561198244239612,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198244239612/,"Ok Review Time!!

First of all this game is amazing and absolutley a worthy sequel to the first game.
I love the direction the game went with its choice of Enemies, The Tyranids have been rarely used outside of the RTS genre and a small splinter fleet of Hive Fleet Leviathan was the Ideal Choice!!
Slightly disappointed at first with Chaos (Again) being used as the second antagonist, but quickly changed my mind when it was Revealed that it was the Thousand Sons, which have been criminaly underused in gaming and instead of one of the more ""Safe"" options such as the Black Leigon in the first game!!
I also Loved the part where you are Underground on an Imperial Tomb World, which ironicaly enough was a Necron Tomb World, so here's hoping in the Future we get some Necrons (My fave Faction) to fight!!
I hope Saber Interactive continues this trend of using underrepresented and overlooked factions and armies into the future!!

All of that being said the game is not without some issues, Mainly being how the Dodge and Parry system doesn't work most of the time, there are many times I've pressed the Parry/Dodge button with the prompt/during the indicator window up onscreen and I still got hit, it got so frustrating that i was doing all the steps to not get hit and I get hit and take damage anyway that i simply gave up trying to use the system about halfway through the game.

Secondly Melee Combat was at the forefront of the gameplay which left the Shooting aspect of the game to feel quite weak and underpowered in comparison.

Third is the customisation of your multiplayer Character, while it seems like Sabre have nailed it it first which they totally have, they have missed some key aspects upon closer inspection. These are quite major things if you think about them and they are as Follows:

Bulwark's Banner, for some reason its always the Ultramarines Standard, NOT the Chapter that you want or expect to be representing, example a Salamanders Space Marine Planting down a Ultramarines Standard Flag.
This makes zero sense and I want to see this Fixed ASAP as its increadably annoying, especialy when you are a fan of other Chapters.

Voice Shouts using the Voice Wheel again suffer from the same exact problem, I dont like the fact that (Insert Chapter's Marine) is shouting out stuff like ""For Guilliman!"" when thats not even there Primearch!!

Finally some Chapter Based cosmetics would be really great to have such as Imperial Fists or Blood Angels based wargear with corect Heraldry.

This review is coming from a perspective of a 40k fan. I am relatively new though, only 5 years ago did I discover this universe, which is quite recent for a universe thats been around since 1987. Since my intoduction I have several painted armies (a space marine one among them) alongside having played some games and listened to a lot of Warhammer books and lore over the years.

Warhammer 40K : Space Marine 2 is a game that absolutely delivers on the experience it was aiming to create while going above and beyond for some aspects while fumbling tiny things along the way. I am pointing this out because this is getting increasingly unusual in the game industry nowadays. Most games coming out trying to sell you a live service while the game is not finished enough to be able to do so. Meanwhile this dev team seems to have taken their time to release a complete product that gives a solid foundation to making a live service work. 3 separate modes, all with a different focus and gameplay experience. Its quite refreshing, but that does not make the game automatically perfect. Lets talk about all of these modes and my thoughts on them.

Campaign: (no spoilers)

This mode continues the story of Demitrian Titus, the protagonist of the first game, with a fancy new narrative 13 years after the games release. Just like the other modes, you can play this mode cooperatively with 2 of your friends, and does a nice job introducing the mechanics of the game in a fun way. The campaign itself is short but sweet, and intentionally tries not to drag on to long, which is good in my opinion because you can't do much character work with a space marine because they are emotionless supersoldiers. The appeal of the campaign are the missions, and the set pieces within them. The 40k universe is bombastic yet intriguing and mysterious, and watching Titus and his team fight through futuristic gothic cities actively being destroyed by the tyranid invasion one moment and navigating through his chapters space ship with tons of details and lore is really fun and engaging. Its like a rollercoaster ride of the 40k universe where they show a lot of the unique and awesome stuff this universe has to offer. I do think it would have been smart of explain some more concepts, especially the ones directly related to the story's plot. A lot of times characters talk about in universe concepts, and people who are new to 40K will just not understand because its never explained. Its tottally playable and comprehensible to a person new going in, but I think its important to explain more stuff to really get them excited about the nuance 40k has compared to other sci-fi universes.

PVE Operations:
This mode allows your to play several missions losely related to the campaign story. Instead of Titus and his squad, you'll be able to play as 6 different classes, and make your own Space Marine. You'll be able to fully customize the look of your character, while completing missions allows you to level up and access new perks and abilities to make your guy stronger over time and really pick a playstyle you like. For 40k fans this is a dream come true since building and painting miniatures is a huge part of this hobby and the amount of customization is pretty vast for game that has just released. Its also not tied to microtransactions and all of the customization (except for a couple skins related to the gold and ultra edition) are earnable through playing the game. No ingame cash shop or lootboxes. The gamemode focusses on replayability with a good variety of maps, enemies and classes alongside the 4, soon to be 5 difficulties, makes it enjoyable over a long period of time. There is also an AI director tha mixes the missions up and tries to suprise you with changes in the enemies that show up and the objectives you must complete along the way. I have some issues with balancing though. The hardest difficulty feels very unstable to play right now, it feels you need to get lucky in order to win, but it’s very satisfying once you do. I also think the Thousand Sons faction are not very fun to fight currently of the way the units are balanced, totally fixable though. Focus has already promised to add more missions, weapons and enemies in the future which will be important to its life service, which in my opinion has the most potential in this game mode.

PVP Eternal War:

I played the least amount of PVP up until now, but it has pleasantly surprised me. It’s structured as a 6vs6 contest where Space Marines go up against Chaos Space Marines, marines who have betrayed the imperium and have sided with the bad guys. There are a couple modes to pick from, and they are all good fun to play with the same 6 classes from PVE. There only 3 maps though, and unlike the Campaign and PVE, there is not a lot of spectacle going on around or inside of them. Instead, this mode is focused on giving you a more competitive experiences, the 6 classes are all rebalanced to facilitate skill expression and game knowledge. The more you play, the more stuff you unlock for your class and once you get the hang of its surprisingly fun and way more intricate than you thought at first. Don’t overlook it, it might be really your thing.

Conclusion:

To me a perfect game is one that gets a lot of little things right, but at the same time, its art, and how it makes you feel is more important than examining and criticizing every detail. Space Marine 2 gives you the power fantasy of you being among the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, something every Warhammer nerd fantasizes about ever since they started painting miniatures or reading/listening to the lore of this amazing universe. You get to go along this personal story of Titus to see something curated and then make your own based on the space marine you decide to make for PVE and PVP. The core gameplay is rock-solid and satisfying, with a lot of inspiration taken from DOOM while keeping its own style from the previous game. Artistically and graphically the game looks exactly like fans would envision the 40K universe alongside the overall sound design being a straight 10. The performance overall is impressive considering how many enemies can appear on screen on top of the orchestra of chaos that’s happening around you.

This by far is the best 40k game I’ve played so far and deserves all the praise and occasional criticism its receiving. I think thats because people, particularly 40k fans, care about this game and its future; the developers have created an awesome foundation for years of live service support and seem committed to fixing issues through their transparent feedback system. The game has already succeeded critically and financially, now it’s up to the devs build on it. If they do, and they are going to from the looks of their roadmap and their history as a developer, I’ll be there playing who knows how many years from now. If they somehow don’t, this game is still an incredible game and is easily worth the 60 you put in.

I recommend it, play it if your PC can run it. Thanks for reading this needlessly long steam review, but at the same time, what is wrong with you? You have wasted approximately 5 minutes not serving the emperor.... The inquisition is heading towards your exact location right now.",Recommended,6034,83.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

+++Reported Review to the Inquisition+++
++=][=++

Space Marine 2 is everything I and most fans of the Warhammer 40k universe could hope for. As a sequel to the original Space Marine game (2011), the game ramps up the intensity, scale of 40k, and brutal action in all the right ways. The feeling of being in the power armor of a Space Marine, facing off against endless hordes of Tyranids in visceral, satisfying combat, and feeling overpowered is captured perfectly. The game makes you feel powerful, and that's what we are here for.

The gameplay shines with its fast-paced mix of melee and ranged combat. The action is really fluid, and the game strikes a perfect balance between being cinematic and offering clear combat, while giving you full control over the chaos on screen. As a third-person shooter, this game manages that surprisingly well.

Graphically, the game is stunning. The environments are epic and definitely in line with 40k standards, capturing the grimdark atmosphere of the 42nd millennium perfectly. Details are really well done, down to a single servitor skull, though perhaps not the best in detail when compared to WH40k: Darktide, where that game takes the lead in the smallest details.
And the sound design? The roar of bolters, the shrieks of Tyranids, the heavy steps of Astartes weighing over a ton, or even those dusty boys with their Assault Cannons or Storm Bolters. The voice acting is also really good, with no cringe or corny lines—a high-risk factor for this type of game. All these and more contribute to the immersive experience.

The Campaign:
We are yet again playing as Titus from the Ultramarine chapter. After the incident on Graia (SM1), we are renowned and demoted from our previous title of Captain, now holding the rank of Lieutenant. We follow our new Captain's orders to help the Recidious system, which is under attack by Hive Fleet Leviathan and perhaps something else from the Immaterium. We are now in the 4th Tyrannic War In the Indomitus Era, where a lot of things are happening in the 40k galaxy, and we are to be part of this war.
Together, you and your squad, under your command, are tasked with setting destruction upon the enemy in multiple well structured missions through 3 different planets. Not spoiling any more, but it's going to be a wild ride.

The co-op mode is also a blast, allowing you to team up with fellow Astartes in the campaign and play it from start to finish with friends. Or, you can complete hard or even harder PvE missions with semi-randomized enemies, enemy locations, points of interest, pick-ups, and bosses. It's the perfect addition for those who want to share the fun with friends, randoms, or even AI bots. The multiple missions, 4 difficulties, and extensive progression system (with 6 different classes, weapon upgrades, character skills, perks, and cosmetics) provide a lot of gameplay. The Astartes customization is really well done and faithful to the lore.
And i think it's one of the biggest reasons to grind this game.
Also, we are getting a lot of free content in the future, like maps, a new mode ""Horde"" (similar to the first game's Exterminatus mode), and new guns, enemies, missions, and difficulties. Who knows, we might even see new classes like Librarian, Chaplain, Terminator, or some specialized Interceptors.

Multiplayer:
This game brings you back to the good ol' days when we didn’t care about our K/D or W/L ratios. We just had fun. The only thing that mattered was the adrenaline surge you got when you were destroying the enemy, either solo or with friends/randoms. Since there are no proper stats, we can play without competitive status to bother us—just levels that unlock new weapons to use and destroy our enemies.

However, the game isn’t without a few rough edges. Some AI behavior can feel a bit broken, like standing still while a Carnifex is mauling you to death, and there are moments where the pacing could be tighter. But these minor issues are overshadowed by the sheer joy of purging alien filth and defending humanity.

If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k games, tabletop, the books, or just love action packed third-person shooters with satisfying combat, Space Marine 2 is an absolute must-play. This is perhaps one of the best 40k video games that there is going to be. This game deserves to be Game of the Year.

Pros:

+Brutal, fluid, and satisfying combat

+Stunning graphics and atmospheric environments

+Really good story

+Faithful to the Warhammer 40k universe lore

+Excellent co-op multiplayer and lots of gameplay loops

+Really good performance and visuals

+Controls on PC and controller are just right, almost the same as in the first game

+/-Challenging

Cons:

-Occasional AI hiccups

-Some audio overlaps in PvE

-No PC chat censor

-No PC and console cross-play in Eternal War, though this is a minor problem, and the devs might change this

-Some pacing issues

Hard in many ways, just like the first game

Obviously there are some things that bug me but I'm not going to cry about them because every new release has them upon release. It is just the nature of things and i have belief that Saber will be implementing fixes.

I'm just excited that we now have this game and are able to enjoy such a lucrative IP in this format.

For Warhammer 40K Fans: A Must Buy
I don't belong to the first group, but I appreciate all the love that went into creating the best WH40K experience so far. The level of detail is insane and so is the performance. I'm running the game in 4K with DLSS Balance and get a stable 60+ on my system (details at the end).

In Warhammer 40K, Sci-Fi meets Gothic, form over function, glory over sanity. While the level design is pretty straight-forward hose-design, the game doesn't hold back on the vast and impressive scenery where meglaomaniac architecture melts with huge battlefields and hundreds of aliens in the background. You fight in the jungle, in industrial structures, huge city scapes that remind me of Mont-Saint-Michel on steroids and in space.

The classes are versatile and so are the weapons. Cosmetics are earned with successful MP mission and while the campaign is comparably short it's very internse and of high quality.

The melee system is not as clunky as some beginners portrait it. Pressing attack like a moron won't get you very far. Not ignoring parry and evade windows is the key to a successful brawl. During successful parries, dodges and execution moves, you're invulnerable while also dishing out strong damage. Learning to use that consistently early on, will make things much easier for you and the group.

I'm playing the game with maxed settings in 4K (2K native with DLDSR 2.5x) and DLSS balance, getting 65-80 FPS with no stuttering, tearing or other annoying inconveniences.

explosivedeer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/explosivedeer/,"... We're getting a Space Marine 3 right? RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT VALVE RIGHT? PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF THE EMPEROR, MAKE MORE OF THIS. A LOT MORE.

It's one of those rare title releases:

Firstly, I want to emphasize the fact that if you haven't played Space Marine 1 before playing this, you're actually doing yourself a disservice. Even if you are not a Warhammer Lore master, the minimum requirement to enjoy the Space Marine titles is simply playing from the start. They put the effort into setting it up as such!

The lore to the universe is so immense and available to explore after the fact you might just find yourself something entertaining. And this game, just like the first, has that draw that so few other titles (in my opinion) have managed to do.

They have balanced the story telling such that you're not given an overly exposed, monotonous, and overwhelming dump of information. You'll find yourself wanting to explore it for yourself on your own time, and at your own pace. It doesn't demand that you need to know anything before jumping in, nor does it make you feel as though you are missing out on too much to understand what is currently happening.

What feeds the extreme fan-base is the depth of the lore and visuals represented with accuracy, and this nails that. It doesn't try to re-write or change anything that already enveloped fans know and enjoy, and it doesn't for a moment do so at the expense of trying to introduce newcomers to the universe. It stands ground and well at that.


Overall, I'm really satisfied with the game mechanics and the weapon variety, not to mention the visual and audio representations. It's actually addictive, but not in a quick-fill dopamine sense, more so via a show of power and story connected presence. It doesn't feel like you have plot armor, but it also doesn't feel like you're the weak guy that needs to do mundane tasks to upgrade and notice the advancements in comparison to the mob character that gave you arbitrary difficulty early on.

My one and only gripe with the gameplay (on the second highest difficulty first playthrough) was the incessant damage and subsequent distraction from ranged enemies. Through self-evaluation, it's abundantly clear that in order to progress smoothly on Veteran, you need to keep moving and abuse the i-frame and armor regeneration to sweep across the battlefield unscathed. And to be honest, I don't have an issue with that premise, if anything it fits in perfectly with what you are. A genetically modified super solider that is meant to purge the heretics in the name of the emperor.

So if you're looking to focus on the story and atmospheric experience, I don't recommend picking a higher difficulty than default out the gate, which is a tad ironic. When was the last time you came across a game that had a challenging difficulty slider? It caught me off guard, and had me frustrated at points, but it never really invoked a cheesiness factor or something that felt tedious. It was an invitation to invest more understanding into the mechanics and for that I can applaud obnoxiously.


WIP


Out the gate, I can say that it does the multiplayer PVP thing. I have no interest in nit-picking the balance or modes. It serves the purpose of a social experience but in that regard it lacks. The modes are alright, but the connectivity remains to be seen. In this current era of gaming where everyone secludes themselves to minute invite-only discord channels, the process of finding new friends to play with can be outright tedious.

I'm banking on what company will be the first to recognize the potential behind API integrations with Discord such that social connectivity is revitalized like it once was with nothing but a forum hosted from someone's PC for the community.",Recommended,3136,15.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
MrArgamas,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrArgamas/,"It's a solid game at its core. The gameplay is reminiscent of Gears of War 5 without the ability to use cover, but with a better melee damage system and a perk tree for both weapons and character classes. You have to fulfil objectives in a world thorn by war, defeating massive wave of enemies at times.

The levels are typically very large with lots of details. Some elements are randomized while playing Operations, but it is quite linear in all cases. We get 6 operations out of the box, and a campaign that is about 8-9 hours long. Story and cinematics are just epic. The diversity in the type of enemies, the waves and the levels feels good. I have cumulated 30 hours of gameplay and the grinding doesn't feel repetitive yet, but I have indeed played a bit of PVP for diversity.

The PVP aspect is also excellent, thanks to the solid shooter mechanics and class abilities. However, you will see the same maps again and again: I've only seen 3 maps so far, and I think that is realistically all we get at the moment.

Some bugs are always to be expected on launch day and this game is no exception, but I didn't encounter any game breaking bug. Sure, you may fail to join a server when you launch a PVP game (as an example), but it will work on the next attempt. You sometime gets stuck for a long time during loadings, but it will usually complete just fine if you are patient (we are talking well over a minute). Nothing too serious, and I am sure it will get patched quickly.

I don't have a lot of negative points, maybe 1-2. The AI is a bit too dumb for PVE at higher difficulty levels. Don't expect him to focus fire enemies that re calling waves, and never expect any coordination between the bots; if you get injured VS a boss that covers a lit of surface like a Hellbrute, chances that you'll get revived at average and higher threat levels are low. Luckily, there is MM included in the game but it is not working really well at the moment. Getting lvl1 players who have 0 experience with the threat level you are trying to play, as an example. Better use discord for LFGs or alternative mm methods (play with friends).",Recommended,1740,62.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

I have some serious problems with the gameplay.

The game can be mildly unresponsive to commands/controls like basic movement, dodging and parrying when you're in the thick of combat.

Sometimes the game just throws too much at you at once and any action becomes pointless except the ""load last checkpoint"" button.

The AI companions CAN and WILL ignore you when you get downed, unlike the first game when you go down; you essentially have three lives, with a basic revive system.
Works great when playing with others, not so much when you are forced to sit there for a minute wondering if the AI is going to even assist you.

I'm a huge fan of the hero-action (hack'n slash) genre and have beaten a plethora of games in it's wake.
Playing this game on ""hard"" feels draining with the control issues previously mentioned, I dare not touch the difficulty above it.

My only critique would be that in PvP lobbies you'll continue playing with the same people unless they leave...

(they get mad and leave) Or you'll join a lobby with an opposing team that is already full of cracked players. By all means I HATE SBMM but make the matches fully end and this wont be an issue.

I went into this game a bit skeptical, a friend recommended it so I gave it a go and it immediately gave me the feeling of a cross between Mass Effect 2/3, Gears of War, Starship Troopers, and Helldiverz. It absolutely captures the gritty stompy feeling of running around as a 1 man army crushing enemies under your heel. The combat feels heavy and real the hits, stomps, blasts and all the rest feel strong and immersive.

I haven't tried pvp yet (waiting for my squad) but I am sure ill have fun and will update after trying it.

I love the varying class systems in operations and the ability to build the same class in different ways, I have a loadout for my Sniper (invis guy) to rely only on his knife and maximizing his melee damage with stealth tricks while my second loadout is a sniper headshot focused class that grants my whole team ultimate guage on headshot kills, my Vanguard (grapnel hook guy) has a perfect parry build and a grapnel execution build.

The game is definitely in need of some more content and some new events or scenarios that shake up the missions but overall the gameplay is awesome and to me and many gamers that is the key! It may not be a perfect game but dammit it is a fun one!

Performance was buttery smooth with FSR at Ultra, there were some drops in really specific encounters, but no more than a few frames.

He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.

Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war.

Encoutered a few annoyances:
- menuing not being too convinient (mostly, I dislike that it takes two screens to set the difficulty+mission combo in the coop mode - it really really REALLY should be one screen). I'd love to see this polished up.
- the game will queue you into lobbies where someone is already playing your class, forcing you to change your class. I feel like that's a bit meh, since I enjoy playing one class for long sessions.
- very rarely (happened about three times in the 18 hours I've played so far) the game will lock you in place for a few seconds after a finisher animation - you're invincible and it'll recover, but it ruins the momentum, allowing the enemies to move away, which is a slight problem for any melee class.

And that's about it. Everything else is awesome. This feels exactly how I'd imagine a supersoldier smashing through the battlefield. The combat system has this heaviness to it, and your hits matter.

I loved the original space marine and while this one did deviate in a few mechanics which actually was a bit refreshing as the game became a bit more challenging (no more executing a bunch of weak mobs for health). The story was epic, the environments for each level were breathtaking and the AI for your squadmates is not that bad (this studio needs to remake Spacehulk, I think they'd kill it).

My biggest critique? I want more. There are some things that happen in game that should lead to a DLC or a Space Marine 3 but with a new foe that would be a direct result of what happens in this one. I won't spoil it but you will find out :).

ENKIMOON,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ENKIMOON/,"At its core SM2 is a polished, focused third person shooter that offers a refreshingly complete package compared to its contemporaries. Most of SM2s core elements are good *enough* on their own but get tied together with genuinely top class presentation that elevates everything on offer here.

The core gameplay loop manages to be stripped down whilst staying just deep enough to be consistently entertaining. The combat model is built around snappy gunplay that flows in and out of hack and slash melee action that does manage to incorporate a decent parry and combo system, although do not go in expecting the depth of anything like a real character action game - what is here is far more comparable to something like the recent God of War games and even then not as complex. What matters most is that it doesn't need to be especially complex in order to stay consistently entertaining. The fights feel great, enemy variety is solid and mostly well designed and the game strings you from one fantastic set piece to the next at a brisk pace. In terms of difficulty this is a fairly challenging shooter at the higher difficulty levels although the single biggest influence on challenge is whether you are playing co-op or not as the bots here are not the best.

In terms of overall variety you're getting three distinct game-modes here: A narrative campaign with optional 3 player co-op that will run you anywhere from 5-10 hours, a mission based PVE operations mode that again features 3 player co-op with a customisable class based progression system (should be noted that this is where the legs of the game seem to be and Focus have already committed to expanding it, this is also where the helldivers comparisons you have undoubtedly heard are relevant), and a pvp multiplayer mode that shares some progression elements and customisation with the operations mode.

The campaign is a direct sequel to the original game narratively although Focus have gone to significant lengths to make this work as a standalone story not only for those who haven't played the original but also for those who have limited/no knowledge of the 40k universe. It does a pretty decent job of telling a pretty standard albeit compelling war story but for fans of 40k there are some pretty decent plot hooks here and cool wider implications. In terms of mission structure and the overall campaign experience, I enjoyed the back half of the campaign a lot more than the front, the early missions have a lot of ""defend this point"" objective set pieces that are uninspired at best and tedious at worst, thankfully the game moves away from this and focuses on letting you explore the combat sandbox through well structured arenas and big set piece moments. The last third of the game is thrilling and it keeps building managing to end really strong which is ultimately what you want from a fairly short campaign.

Visual presentation and audio design are excellent, giving pretty much the best rendition of the 40k universe that has ever been put to a screen. Weaponry feels excellent with great feedback and weighty impacts that are reflected by responsive enemy modelling and animation. The overall atmosphere is peak large scale 40k, it doesn't quite match something like Darktide in terms of sheer oppressiveness and that game and Mechanicus both feature better OSTs but SM2 is no slouch in either regard.

To briefly the discuss the other modes on offer: I think the PVE operations have a lot of potential, the game uses an AI director similar to Left 4 Dead and other horde based games and on higher difficulties you do have those ""oh ♥♥♥♥"" moments that have made the genre so popular. The missions also benefit massively from not being procedurally generated, something that was a major contributor to how stale Helldivers 2 became after a dozen or so hours. Everything here is handcrafted and whilst the drawback is that the content on offer is a bit limited and will take time to produce, it is all high quality with unique mission framing and compelling objectives. Progression and customisation are great as they kind of need to be for a game based on a miniature wargame famous for its sheer diversity of design. I have some nitpicks that will matter to passionate 40k fans: theres a lack of chapter specific visual flair e.g no thematic armour pieces like cloaks and tassels for white scars or scales for salamanders etc ; also everything here is very much a product of the uniformity of GWs Primaris designs and if you hate them, you are not gonna get much reprieve here, I would like to see some of the classic SM iconography e.g Corvus helmets brought in. Also Heretic Marines are only playable in the PVP and they have no armour customisation outside of basic paint jobs and decals, this may change down the line but for now its worth mentioning.

On the topic of the PVP the original game was famed for managing to keep a small but dedicated community of players on board for over a decade after its release (shout out CM Valrak) and I think whats on offer here has similar potential but as it currently stands it feels unfinished. There is a real shortage of both game modes, weapon variety and especially maps. The maps here are way too small, spawns are bad and I would really like to see some different types of maps as most of them feel fairly similar. I like the foundations Focus have laid down but like the PVE this is a case of ""good start but show me more"".

TLDR: SM2 is a fantastic package that stands out amongst a landscape of half-finished content poor AAA releases. The presentation and core gameplay loop are excellent, the Campaign is a blast that gets better as it goes, PVE has tonnes of potential (especially if you are fed up with HD2) and the PVP is fun but needs some work.

BrainSphere,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BrainSphere/,"Space Marine 2
Let me preface by saying this is more a list of pros and cons and is biased entirely towards the melee experience, I have played Assault religiously. I love real difficulty, not the artificial crap but the real stuff. Payday 2 DSOD, VM2 Cataclysm and Onslaught, Darktide Auric Storm and countless other hellish experiences. Space Marine 2 absolutely has the ability to deliver this with some fine-tuning in the future but the current experience is rough around the edges the longer you play and advance. Despite that, I believe this game is worth it, and the developers should be supported.

An incredibly beautiful and heartfelt experience, the developers actively listen and respond to the community, clearly care about the source material and they've created some of the most beautiful graphics to immerse yourself in the carnage.

Melee combat just clicks, perfect parries, perfect dodges, gunstrikes, beautiful executions. The first few hours you play will blow your mind away, not to mention the difficulty and initial learning curve is perfect.

I'd be here all day breaking this down but to put it as simple as possible: If there were 50 melee enemies after me, I can and have beat them before with use of all the aforementioned mechanics alongside the memorised combos they do, but if you were to add just even 3 small ranged units shooting me 50 metres away, I'm dead in probably 20 seconds and there is nothing skillful I can do to counter this as Assault, my preferred class. Assault is easily the weakest because it lacks utility, functionality, and a worthwhile ability; the strongest and most efficient use of the Assault's jump-pack is to simply stall and run away when the chips are down so you can get reinforcements. Vanguard mogs Assault having played both classes, not just in melee efficiency but in immense measurable utility for yourself and team.

Did I mention they take countless melee attacks? They do not give a damn. Thunderhammer in their face? They do not care, they will just attack. Jump pack attack or charged attack? Nah they get Insane I-frame dodges that break your tracking and teleports that can actually send them behind walls and covers and allow them to instantly counter attack with an unblockable flame attack, SUCK IT Astartes trash! Behold the trickery of Tzeentch!

Take every con I've mentioned, now play on the hardest difficulty, now crank it from a 7 to an 11. They. Are. Overtuned. The issues of a pure melee experience is exasperated 100-fold when you play assault against them. Every Majoris enemy will teleport away before you can kill them with melee, this becomes a problem when they teleport off-screen or into a pack of 20 other different chaos marines. You will whittle them down slowly but never be able to efficiently take them down, though this feels very in their ballpark, it just feels plain bad. At least give me a way to counter this. Here is the irony, Extremis thousand sons are easier to kill. Yeah, no seriously, they really are, I can easily parry and perfect dodge their moves and finish them off because they do not teleport away. Every single unit is overtuned.

IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW. I HAVE SPENT 10 ENTIRE SECONDS PRESSING NOTHING BUT PARRY, REACTING TO THEIR JUMPS. THERE IS 0 COUNTERPLAY OR OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THIS, ANY OTHER OPTION WILL RESULT IN HEALTH LOSS. THEY WILL ACTIVELY DISREGARD ANY ATTACK YOU DO AGAINST THEM, HYPER ARMOUR OUT THE WAZOO. No probs if you have a melta though, looking at you Vanguard.

The manufactorium unfortunately, does not provide. Instead we have the ali-express power armour that disintegrates when even looked at the wrong way.

76561199092080973,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199092080973/,"Space Marine 2 is quite possibly one of THE BEST Warhammer games to ever release. So far I have only completed the campaign and am just now dipping my toes into the other modes but what I can say it is a truly immersive experience into the Warhammer 40K Universe. The sounds and sights are great as well as the brutal combat against many foes. There is also plenty of fanservice moments for those who played the first game but it is not necessary to have played it to enjoy this game. Despite all the good things about this game however not everything is good.

My main gripe are the AI companions in the campaign. To put it plainly, they're very dumb and sometimes I think they may be Heretic Astartes because they never seem to actually kill the enemy very often. They'll just run around not being very useful while you have to take care of everything yourself. Now this wouldn't be too much of a problem if the enemy AI also didn't prioritize the player over the AI companions. This isn't too much of an issue on easy or normal, but if you play on Veteran as I did for the first half of the campaign that's where the issues start. Veteran is thoroughly difficult, but it wouldn't be so bad if the whole galaxy's population of tyranids weren't just beelining straight to the player's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at any given time. At times this just makes it almost impossible to play at certain objectives during specific missions. In short, I would not recommend playing the campaign on anything hard than normal without some buddies just because of the difficulty.

Regardless of the issue I stated before though, Space Marine 2 is a GREAT Warhammer game and one I think fans will enjoy years to come. It definitely sets the bar for future titles, a bar that will most likely be very difficult to fulfill. Despite this, I think the developer Saber Interactive has shown us that they have what it takes to make a good Warhammer game and I look forward to their future developments.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading, in short buy it right now. Have a great day everyone.

tigerdragon180,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tigerdragon180/,"Had a bumpy start but this has been a great experience. The game is amazing even down to the environmental story telling, seeing all the choke points and defensive spots that the guard had set up, seeing the bodies where a servitor killed a gaunt here, a group of soldiers killed a warrior there....amazing. The game play, took some time to get used to but equally amazing.

Coop, it took a bit getting used to, but amazing, a group of 3 players running the gauntlet together.


my downsides? initially i had issues with the cinematic, ran into 2 issues, my graphics driver needed an update, and for some reason running on my 2nd SSD (same model and everything) it would have super high load times and stuff....when i moved it to my C drive instead it worked fine, thats been about it. coop i feel needs some more intro work, like push people into coop mode and point them towards the armory first so they dont feel rushed into a match.",Recommended,768,48.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

76561198003037604,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003037604/,"Pros:
- Fantastic visuals that capture the 40k aesthetics
- Good variety in playstyles among the classes
- Good visual customization by individual armour parts
- Satisfying gunplay and melee, visceral finishers
- Large arsenal of weapons, each with minor variations along their own progression paths
- Tyranids are extremely well realized. They nailed the scope of the swarms.

The Gargoyle swarms absolutely managed to convey the scope of a tyranid invasion. While it should be even worse than this, it’s a perfectly fine approximation given limited computing power.
Tyranid dynamics were translated nicely into gameplay. Take out the warrior, so the gaunts collapse, take out the Hive Tyrant to bring an entire assault to a screeching halt.
All the special bioforms feel distinctive and accurate, with the Lictor being my favourite. The fact that auspex scan reveals him, that the initial boss encounter is basically Predator and the sound cues whenever a lictor is lurking make it a great experience.




Cons:
- Characters are cardboard cut-outs you cannot customize. Wanna play the vanguard? You gonna be playing as Decimus Jackson Jr.

- Cast and general cutscene presentation:

The cast is tragically flat. Titus being a miserable cu** is fitting, but Gadriel is needlessly antagonistic just to construe drama, and Chairon is alright, I guess. Also zero facial expressions on Gadriel.

Captain McAngus is the usual trope, hates your guts at first, but comes around when he realizes you were right all along. Boring, no air about him, probably just a GW mandated Phobos Captain miniature insert.

Amon-Ra was so-so. He had some glimpses of personality and an overall interesting design, but there was just not enough screen time to really explore his character. I’d have wished for a more fleshed out characterization because there was good potential there, especially for a tzeentchian manipulator.

Worst of all was Calgar though, no gravitas nor intensity, looked comical fighting. Could’ve had a badass scene of him 1on1ing the Swarmlord or something. Anything really to mark him as the chapter master. Quite disappointing.

In general, it seems like they couldn’t match the intensity from the actual gameplay in the cutscenes. They feel lifeless, often uncanny and unfinished. I really wanted to be done with the campaign asap to enjoy ops mode without spoilers, which is not a good sign in my book.

That being said, the actual meat of the game is good. Melee and shooting feel great, once you’ve gotten the hang of the combat flow. Tyranids are more developed on that front, with Tzeentch providing a slight spike in difficulty while lacking the satisfaction of gory finishers and internal faction dynamics.
I’ll probably spend a good amount of time playing operations, as the classes feel distinct enough to get fresh experiences out of them, even with the limited mission set.

I played through all of campaign on hard and a bit of multiplayer, long story short: campaign is great, multi could be better. I'm gonna go over what problems I noticed so it may sound a bit negative, but overall I'm having a blast with the game, so if you want some Warhammer power fantasy, this is the game

Campaign
I'll try to make this as technical as possible and [REDACT] any spoilers
I liked the story, I loved the visuals and cherished the weapons.

Not gonna talk much about story overall, characters are servicable, they are Astartes, so you don't expect highly emotional and expressive performance, they do a good job conveying their arcs, and the plot kept me engaged.

Visuals are amazing. The arenas and setpieces as well as cutscenes are absoultely gorgeous, however there is a huge whiplash when pre-rendered cutscene cuts to in-game one, and there is one bizzare scene, where Again, don't wanna get too much into individual examples, cause story, I'll only say .

About music... to be honest I didn't hear it most of the time (mixing is a bit weird), so not much to say here.

In terms of guns all of them are distinct, the sound and feedback is great (tho there are minor issues, like altfire for underbarrel grenade launcher clipping sideways from hand), and the melee weapons and executions let you unleash absolute, glorious and cinematic carnage only made better with executions.

That said, there are also issues. For campaign melee is the way to go, and for a good reason. But there are some tanky ranged enemies, which can be a pain to deal with. You see, most weapons seem to be designed for close- to mid-range combat (in multiplayer I saw a tooltip about most weapons damage decreasing with distance, don't know if it works in campaign too), so you have to either get closer to aforementioned enemies (if you can, they sometimes are on inaccessible ledges/platforms, or they just shoot you on approach), or shoot half your ammo into them, which might be problematic, because most of the time you are engaged in melee. You can use some long range guns, but then they are not very good at dealing with any other enemies. In my opinion adding a bit of stagger to shots and making you able to aim while running with side weapon would solve this a bit, and also make the small gun serve a purpose beside finishers.
The second problem: these flying f***s. You'll know which ones. This is mostly extention of previous thing, except you can't get to melee range with them at all. They have powerful range attacks and they buff the hordes. So on one hand game tells you to focus them as sort of sergeants, but you can only do this with ranged weapons (and trust me, those guys soak up your ammo) while dodging their attacks AND managing chaff. Tbh they are manageable on their own, but when there's 2 or more, you don't even have that much time to shoot at them, because you have to dodge them (some cooldown shared between all of them would be nice, but then It'd look like they are getting in queue to attack, I don't know). I'm focusing on them so much, because fighting them is one of the very few moments, that feel tedious during the game.
Also, play campaign on the controller if you can, it really isn't made for mouse and keyboard.

I'll be a bit more critical here, but that may be, because from the beginning I wanted to play the Assault class, which I think suffers from some key problems in the mode.

Remember earlier when I said melee is the way to go in campaign? Well here it's the complete opposite, I have to remind myself constantly to not use melee. During melee you are almost completely still, and time before swings is long enough enemies will just run away and shoot you, and it doesn't do that much damage, (which is weird IMO, in gameplay perspective powerful melee is the incentive to get close and take risks, here it just isn't worth it, on assault after slamming next to an enemy it is better to shoot them with a bolt pistol than use melee. And that is if they don't shoot you down on approach) This may be better with Bulwark, but I haven't played it, and they have a shield, so they at least won't be shot on approach.

""So ok, slamming down on enemies doesn't work, so I'll just try shooting them while hovering."" Yeah, about that. Remember when I told you about tooltip saying damage falls with distance? Assault has a sidearm only, so you have to be close to hit your shots and deal meaningful damage. But you don't wanna be close, 'cause then other class with proper range option will just outdamage you (Emperor forbid you get too close to heavy). Long range rifles don't suffer from that, as their damage doesn't fall off, and they love a hovering immobile target on open space.

This is a bit of a rant, but I feel like every other class has a way to deal with the disadvantage, I myself had some success with Assault, but mostly when enemy team either didn't look up or I could ambush some solo players, but if they correct for that, it's over. I just love jump packs and desperately want them to have a place, I'm biased here and I don't care. I think melee damage should be upped and some movement during melee added, in this state I think it is just underwhelming, and dueling a World Eater in PvP would be awesome.

Also, left side cover is OP, your crosshair being on right side of your model makes peaking from right side of cover very good, and peaking from left side very bad, as enemies see you before you can see them. EA Battlefront solved it by allowing you to switch the side crosshair is on, but I don't know if it is possible here, so I'll just say it's something you have to keep in mind.

The game is awesome. The multi is fun. Contents of this review are critical in due to tendency to focus on the bad, me being salty about state of jump pack b0i and avoiding spoiling the game. I had a real blast playing through it and I'll be playing co-op with a friend soon, looking forward to playing this and any future content, great job devs.",Recommended,4956,54.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

The game has 3 aspects - Campaign (Story), PVE Operations (CO-OP) and PVP.

The campaign is serviceable enough, albeit basic and the story is nothing to write home about. The story is the classic ""hero is for some reason the chosen one and gets dropped into a myriad of crazy situations which for some reason only they can solve"". It's nothing new, but it gets the ball rolling and sets up the world in a way that's easy to understand. Anyone who knows the WH40K universe will not have anything mind-blowing come up here, and those new to the universe will probably recognize many of the themes. It IS pretty cool to see some characters from the wider universe show up or be mentioned, though.

The campaign is mostly there to introduce several mechanics, combat and weapons, which you will use everywhere else in the game. it's still a fun ride, just nothing amazing.

The PvE coop is a blast. There's a lot of progression to be had, 6 unique classes each with variations on their playstyle, several weapons and toolkits that each class can use, and so on. There's a ""grind"" associated with levelling up a class, unlocking more abilities and cosmetics, but there are NO micro-transactions and you simply have to play the game to get stronger, which (and I can't believe we've gotten to this point) is honestly a breath of fresh air in today's gaming landscape. Similar to Helldivers 2 in a way, progression is gated behind playing, and there are no fat-wallet shortcuts.

The gameplay in the PVE coop missions is similar to the campaign. Incredibly fun, power-fantasy-filled combat, with slightly varying objectives between runs, several difficulty options and many customization options to unlock. The class based system makes for interesting compositions and characters will have different dialog depending on which classes were picked for a given mission. Overall this is a good, strong opening, for a game that will be growing in scope in the live service model.

PVP is, well, basic. Definitely not the game's focus, but its very fun and brings the late 2000s early 2010s vibe of slower shooters with higher TTKs and more emphasis on positioning and teamplay rather than ""cracked 14 year olds with ADHD"" levels of AIM. Some classes (Bulwark) are a bit frustrating to play against, but this will probably get toned down a bit as developers are already aware. The game's not even out yet (officially), so its kinda hard to really address balance issues in a meaningful way.

The big elephant in the room which I haven't mentioned is the servers and matchmaking + myraid of loading screens. This is a massive downside and stability is massively affected by this. Every PVE mission is a crapshoot as to whether you will successfully load in, and then, upon completion, successfully see the rewards screen. You will get the rewards regardless, but you might not see them being dolled out, leading to a hard ALT+F4 restart being required. This is less of an issue for PvP, but still happened once across my 40 or so matches.

All in all, definitely a game I would not skip. It's going to really shine in the next couple of months, and those will be the best time to play it, as games like this tend to die out slowly after the initial hype, with people returning when new content drops.",Recommended,2784,69.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

76561198013830544,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013830544/,"Being a big Fan of Warhammer 40k, I couldn't wait for this game to release. But with the current landscape, I was a bit sceptical of the final product. I also jumped into this game straight after beating Wukong. So Space Marine 2 had some big shoes to fill. I will divide this review into 3 parts. Getting this prelude out of the way, lets head into the review.

Disclaimer: I'm dutch and dyslectic (meaning i can't write for shtt), so I will apolegize for grammatical errors and writing errors in advance.

The Campaign:

This campaign picks up after the first game and follows Titus. If you are jumping into this game, i would strongly advise you to play the first game. As there is a red line of story that it follows from the previous game right on trough to the end of this second campaign. You could also watch a recap, if space marine 1 is to old for your liking.

The good:
The story is not to long, not to short and is a thrill from beginning to end. The cutscenes and background (wars being fought on the horizon) are great. The tutorial is woven into the narrative and makes it one of the best tutorials i've played in a while. Just due to the story and spectical. The rest of the story is comparable to the thrill ride you know from games like Gears of War or even Halo. The characters are written well enough and actually talk like they are from the 40k universe. The game also doesn't pull any punches. Death is all around you and normal humans die like its going out of style. Co-op also works like a charm, eventough the servers were getting hammered during the early acces.

The bad:

It can feel a bit furmulaic and apart from the story, there is no reason to do the campaign. There are no upgrades, unlocks (apart from your loadout), or real cosmetic options to dripp up Titus. The game also has a need to escalte things further and further to the point it sometimes becomes to ludicrous for its own good (im talking about the ending). The bots are also horrendous. If you play the campaign on your own and wanna complete it on the highest difficulties, I would recommend to get a pillow to bite in and some lube. Your on your own and the bots will cheer the enemies on while your having a fit after dying the third time in a row.

Multiplayer: Co-op and PvP

Its great. The pve missions are replayable and getting to know the maps is a big part of tackling them on harder difficulties. Make no mistake, this game can get HARD. If you just wanna hit buttons, this game will whoop your bottom. There is also no point in doing these harder missions on higher difficulties with bots. But with people, this becomes a tactical game where you have to lean on eachothers shoulders to make it trough. Sharing healthpacks, ammo and grenades to get the best chance of making it to the end. The custumisation is also great. Enough chapters to pimp your Space Marine to your hearts liking. I would also like to point out that the game is a huge commercial succes (by the looks of it) so there will be more content in the future. The progression in unlocking cosmetics and gear is also nicely woven into just playing the game. The gear you use have stats and you got a few versions per class to run with. You can also further personalise with perks on weapons and on your character.

The pvp is also great. It feels balanced and fun. A match takes between 10 to 15 minutes and brings back the old formula of just 6 v6 with loadouts to beat eachother into the ground 40k style. Its fluent, doesn't take long to find matches and people are not toxic in the 30-40 matches ive played. pregression in this is halway interlinked with the co-op mode, so cosmetic unlocks carry over between modes.

The bad:
IT NEEDS MORE MEAT ON ITS BONES WITH BOTH MODES. You got 6 operations for the co-op experiance. a run will take between 30-50 minutes depending on the difficulty and skills of your squad. But after having run them all for a few times now, I suspect some people will tire of it. I however like it and getting to know the maps, makes me better at it in higher difficulties. The PvP mode is lacking in maps. At launch there are only 3 maps. Eventough the PvP might be one of the best modes in the game. Lets hope they will add to it. The chaos marines also disappoint in the lack of custumisation of them.

Technical:

The game runs great on my machine, but i got a pretty beefy one at that. 4080, 13700k, 64 gb ram at 6400mhz ddr 5. I got a friend that has issues due to an old cpu. With the amount of enemies, the cpu is getting hammered. So you might wanna put an alarm to 1 hour and 30 minutes to check if the game is running, so in the event of having problems...you can refund.

The servers are struggling. I think they didn't expect so many people to jump into the game (at Early acces no less). At launch i suspect the servers to buckle.

Final:

I would rate the game an 8/10 as it is now. With future content being added to it, it might become a 9.5/10. But they could also ruin it if the content takes to long or them turning this into dress up my spacemarine microtransactionpalooza 40k edition. I recommend this game if you are an 40k fan or gears of war fan. If you are not, check out some videos to know for sure.

76561198014222191,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014222191/,"I just finished the campaign after 12 hours and still have 3 operations left to do, which is about 1 hour more of content. Sure, the 6 operations are meant to be repeatable, the same way Left 4 Dead, Darktide, Diretide missions are meant to be repeatable. Same concept: A linear map with completion of certain objectives, with some rewards for limited exploration. If you like that type of repetitive gameplay, then you'll enjoy this.

The Co-Op progression is nice so far. You have 2 progression paths, the class progression and the weapon progression.

Leveling up the class gives you access to more class cosmetics and class perks, to improve/change your playstyle of that specific class.

Leveling up the weapon gives you access to improved weapons stats, cosmetics as well as weapon perks. The weapon progress is shared among all classes that use that weapon, which is very nice, makes so that if you like a particular weapon, but want to change classes, if that class uses that weapon, you continue with that progression.

The problem I see (maybe it might amount to nothing), is that there are only 6 maps for the Co-Op experience right now. Usually Left 4 Dead kind of games have 10+ missions. But if you think about it, Left 4 Dead started with 7 missions and Left 4 Dead 2 started with 6 when they came out, and they were great games.

I saw some reviews and there are some people complaining about connectivity issues. I haven't had such, so I cannot speak about that.

One last thing, that bothered me a bit, is that it seems that no two players can use the same class at the same time. At least not when joining someone else's game midway. The same is with Deep Rock Galatic. As the host, you have the option to limit or allow class repetition. Maybe it's the same here, I don't know.

Since they will continue to release new content over time, new missions and such, it will get better over time, as they all did. Is it worth it now? That is up to you.

Release Date: 05/09/2024 (PRE-RELEASE)

Overview
In ""Space Marine 2,"" players once again take on the role of Captain Titus as he battles against the relentless forces of Chaos and the Tyranids, a swarm-like alien race.

The game is set to deliver improved visuals, more dynamic environments, and larger battles, taking full advantage of current-gen hardware.

As the Imperium of Man faces overwhelming odds, Captain Titus must lead his squad through war-torn environments, using a mix of brutal melee and powerful ranged combat to defend humanity from annihilation. The story explores themes of duty, sacrifice, and the eternal struggle against the dark forces threatening the galaxy.

Pros
The Story is breath taking, it will make you fully immersed.











The gameplay in ""Space Marine 2"" centers on fast-paced, brutal combat as players control Captain Titus, blending heavy melee attacks with powerful ranged weapons. It emphasizes the visceral experience of being a Space Marine, allowing players to chain attacks, execute combos, and use tactics to battle the Tyranid hordes. Designed to capture the intensity and scale of Warhammer 40,000, the game offers a mix of strategy, skill, and raw power.

Pros
- Short campaign but was really good. There were many cinematic and super epic moments and I enjoyed every bit of it.
- Combat is really fun
- Nice armor customization
- Visually stunning
- Devs seem to be going through a lot of player feedback on their Focus forum and plan to implement stuff requested by the community
- Netcode seems to be pretty good. I can play with friends overseas with 200+ ping and not feel it.
- For the Emperor

Cons
- Only 6 repeatable missions. However it's a new game so it is to be expected.
- Operations feel a little lack luster compared to the campaign. In the campaign we had really epic fight sequences and last stands that really gave me a thrill. However operations felt extremely tame and it didnt help that basically every class had a reserved and quiet personality. I was hoping for a battle-cry of some sorts like in Darktide where a swarm of enemies charged you while you swung back yelling ""FOR THE GOD EMPEROR""
- Narrative-wise, I was hoping operations mode was going to be similar to Darktide where we are a strike team of space marines deployed to ""actual"" missions instead of just rerunning a campaign story but from a different perspective. This leads me to my next point.
- The customization is a little restrictive in terms of the space marine themselves since we play as named characters akin to Vermintide. I do hope eventually we get true customization for our space marines as it does feel weird having my Dark Angel referred to as an Ultramarine or dropping the chapter banner as bulwark but its an Ultramarine banner.
- No true offline mode for operations. If you wanted to solo operations mode, it may not work out as people can quick match into your game. Also if you play offline it doesn't save your progress.",Recommended,1496,87.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

However, since the core game play is great, after the post release patch which addresses these issue, I have no dought this will be a great game.

PS. I found that campaign difficulty was over tuned. Playing on veteran originally which is the hard mode, I found the game incredibly frustrating; I imagine this is because the game was balanced around coop play since your ai squad mates are virtually useless.

I've been playing this game for over 15 hours so far and I can confirm that it's a truly addicting experience although not without flaws and bugs.I haven't completed the campaign yet but I can already see it's very much Warhammer 40k lore-accurate and with well written narrative. Brutal, ""bloody"" and full of testosterone...and that's how it should be ;)

It's been a while since a TPP shooter game has been keeping me so much interested and involved.
According to other reviews, the campaign is less than 10h long but for me, it's the Co-op online mode (called ""Operations"") gave me the most fun so far.

I can also confirm that despite being multi-platform product, the developers did a very good job in regards to game's optimalization.

The biggest problem for now is servers' capacity. Most likely Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment didn't realize how popular the Co-op and PvP modes will become...and we are still before the official release date.
They need to fix this as soon as possible and add more maps...and if possible maybe some more enemy variety?

As a 40K fan from the books to the games, I am overly pleased and blown away at the game's detail, gameplay and scope.

The gameplay is clearly a step-up from the simplicity of the first game, adding in just the right amount of abilities, combat mechanics and weaponry.

The campaign's story is hype and larger in scope compared to the first game.

The PvE missions which are closely tied to the campaign are impressive and fun (adds to replayability). At some points I was reminded of Destiny's raids in terms of scale and puzzles (just slimmed down). I am very excited to hear that more of these PvE ops will be added for free in the future. Eternal War PvP is short and sweet, along with what feels like a good balance of classes and perks.

The game's linear progression in the campaign and short single-player reminds me of games from a decade ago, matching the first game's length. If you really enjoyed the first one, this is your new best friend.

Technical issues like crashing in loading screens, crashing after mission completes, server drops, and other small bugs are occasional but not extreme.

Short review: Do I recommend the game? Yes. But to people who are interested in Warhammer 40k. And not the expensive editions, just buy the regular one.

Long review: I loved the first Space Marine, actually, I beat it last week for the first time in anticipation for the sequel.
Space Marine 2 leaves you in awe of how amazing the environments look. The hordes are stunning and give you the ""oh shi-"" feeling when you realize that the hundreds of Tyranids running towards you aren't some backdrop but the actual enemies you'll have to fight.

Some gameplay mechanics are questionable. Executions now replenish armor instead of health unlike in the first game, this makes sense from a Co-Op point of view but in the campaign it really pulls you out of the moment and frustrates you. In fact, if you fully die, you just restart from the previous checkpoint with reset to your ""downed"" limit. Which means that if you got into a boss fight with just ""down"" left, it's better to just let the boss kill you to restart the fight with a reset ""down"" count.

I'm also not a fan of the limited weapon slots. In the previous game you had your pistol, your primary and two other slots for big guns. In this game, you have your pistol, your primary, and an occasional big gun which you can pick up but have to drop if you want to switch to the others. This left me wishing I had picked another gun as my primary before specific boss fights.

There were very few bugs, and I had encountered only 1 soft block during a mission, but luckily I had a checkpoint right before so I reloaded and didn't lose any progress. Checkpoints in this game are very generously provided.

The game is great for 40k fans, but some of the gameplay mechanics make it frustrating to play on the higher difficulties. I played on the ""Veteran"" difficulty which is the second highest and the intended one by the devs, and I do wonder if people were even more frustrated with the highest difficulty.

Tl;Dr: Space Marine 2 is a great game for 40k fans but will likely leave non-fans frustrated due to a handful of gameplay design choices that really piss you off. Only the standard edition is worth it, don't waste your money.",Recommended,1844,14.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

The improvements this game has made since the first game are absolutely unbelievable. Space Marine 2 introduces a new unique melee and ranged combat system, massively upgraded graphics, massively updated visuals, introduces new weapons and so, so much more. This game is a MUST PLAY!

The new combat system in Space Marine 2 is a very unique in depth system. Just like in the first game, you can obviously still shoot, hack, and slash. The biggest difference in the Combat System in Space Marine 2 is Parrying. You can now Parry attacks from the Tyranids, and I've just gotta say that I am a HUGE fan of it. When you are about to be attacked, there will be a blue indicator indicating that you are about to be attacked. You press whatever button you have it set to, and then you succesfully pull off the parry. When you parry an attack you get this sick animation of you obliterating the Tyranid. The dodging mechanic is very similar to the first game, but there are also indicators of when you are suggested to dodge. Also, The executions you can perform on the Tyranids are just absolutely awesome.

I haven't finished the Campaign as of now, but so far it is just awesome. Just like the first game you play as Captain Titus, and your goal is to ultimately prevent the Tyranid Invasion. If you don't want spoilers then skip the rest of this paragraph. This intro is super epic... me describing it in this review obviously doesn't do it justice, but this is probably the best intro to a game I have seen in a while.

I did have some issues getting the game to launch, but once I got the game working it runs very well. I recommend tweaking the settings before you start the Campaign. My main recommendation would be to cap your frame rate straight away, but otherwise unless you know you need to make any other tweaks, you are good to go.

Overall, I think this game is a MUST PLAY, especially if you played the first Space Marine Game. If you liked the first game in the series, I can almost guarantee you will love this game. Sure, the parrying may take some getting used to, but once you learn the parry system the combat is awesome, especially with the executions.",Recommended,1836,36.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

CoollizardKaldrogk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoollizardKaldrogk/,"This game has the feel and vibe of a game made in the late 2000s, early 2010s. The way the multiplayer and the PvE modes play wouldn't be out of place in that era, minus the graphics. This isn't as common nowadays, if at all. So in a weird way, it's a refreshing change that I don't hate at all.

The game currently lacks any microtransactions, and apparently there's no concrete plans for modern microtransaction models. You want new cosmetics? Play the game modes. You want new weapons? Play the game modes. This is good. I like this.

The gameplay feels similar to how the first Space Marine did, with significant improvements in some areas, and a few missteps. The biggest issue comes in the form of the difficulty, as some enemies are just obnoxiously too powerful on their own, with the methods that they swarm you making it all the worse to deal with. This really only is an issue I've found with the Tyranids. The moment you get to your second set of enemies, it's nowhere near as bad.

Also what is the point of a heavy bolter if a simple SHIELD can stop it?",Recommended,874,20.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

TLDR: If you really enjoy 40k Lore, great 3rd person mechanics, and/or a game where you and two other buddies wants to have a game. This is it, you don't got to look any further. PVP Multiplayer is very basic and isn't really the focus of the game, but there is a PVP mode (6vs6)

The Long Read: So far this Game is pretty well polished. I've played multiple Operations (Co-op short campaigns where you can customize.) Co-op Campaign up to the 3rd mission (That seems short but the campaign missions so far have been extremely well paced and full of content.) and a ton of multiplayer PVP.

I do feel that the main strength of this game is the co-op operations and campaign. A ton of detail has been put into every single mission that is honestly amazing. Seeing so much attention to details to things in Current 40k Lore as well as Old 40k Lore is stunning, Seeing every thing in the scale that the game presents is great.

I unfortunately think at the moment that the Multiplayer is a bit too fast paced. There's currently only Three close quarters maps where games can last from 5 mins to 10 mins. Respawns are on average of 3 seconds. There is no in depth strategy to any of the modes. It's simply first team to kill 50 wins, or gets 200 points by standing on objectives without it being contested wins.

Short System Info
CPU: I-7 10700KF
GPU: Nvidia 3070GTX
Ram: 32 GB

So far the only game bugs I've seen is sometimes there will be players who fail to load into lobbies / games, and will have to crash out. This has happened to me Twice myself in 2 days of playing. If any one else experiences this in your lobby, they will be booted back to lobby or launched into a game without said player. I am hoping that they fix this in the next patch.

Hope this helps any one. And I hope that they add more features into PvP!",Recommended,1546,64.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

cs2isbad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cs2isbad/,"The Warhammer Game We Have Been Waiting For. But,
Space Marine 2 is an amazing game and excellent entry to the Warhammer 40k series. Most of us know that GOOD Warhammer games are hard to come by. Many games were hit and miss & eventually faded away to time. But, this entry to the series in my honest opinion is going to be what puts this amazing series on the map more than ever. New and Seasoned fans are going to be in for a delight as they mow their way through the Tyranid filth & Expel the heretical chaos cults. It has been so long since we felt this way. Warhammer fans rejoice. This game offers something to scratch the needs of almost all players. Looking for a campaign? We got it . Looking for a PVE co-op experience? We got it . Looking for a PVP experience? We got it . Rejoice! Games Workshop finally did something good! Took them a while if you ask me. Huge shout-out to saber.

As good as the game is. It is far from perfect, this game has a lot of inconsistencies and missing features that I would've not come to expect in a title such as this. So I will try my best to break it down & be honest. ( I am a long time warhammer fan ) for reference.

The campaign is good but, its not great. It feels like they wanted to combine God Of War & Dark-tide. But ultimately it fell a tad short based on my opinion. For such a series packed to the BRIM with lore and amazing characters. I felt like a-lot was missing from the experience. The voice-acting felt a bit complacent and dull. Some moments where good, some moments where bad. Overall I felt a inconsistent experience. A-lot of the factor starts to wear off pretty quickly. Once you experience it a few times. It starts losing its touch real fast.

Now Space Marine 2 has two different co-op experiences that it can offer. The co-op campaign & the operations mode. The Co-op campaign is as much as you'd expect from this game. Its fun, moderately paced & great with friends. Operations mode feels like it lacks quite a-lot of repeatability. Every mission is the same with the only change being where you grab an objective off a corpse. There is no ""modifiers"" or anything else that you can think of to keep a fresh experience or, a less bland one. The only variation you get is your classes and armors. That's all. To me, thats a HUGE let-down. Warhammer: Dark-tide offers more variation in one mission then all the operation missions do combined. Thats a big oof if you ask me. I don't ever really feel like running those missions more than once its really worth my time as it becomes boring and repetitive quite quickly. Truly is a shame as I feel like the selling point for this game was its operations mode.

Ok, if you're looking for call of duty, wrong game. If you're looking for Counter Strike, wrong game. If you're looking for laggy servers, unbalanced classes, unbalanced weapons & bugged multiplayer search lobbies. You're in the right place. The versus mode in this game is heresy. It is the work of a champion of chaos. It is totally a mess, borderline unplayable and just not fun at all. The entire versus experience feels rushed and un-polished. Why is a bulwark in my lobby tanking bullets from 5 different marines shooting directly at him? No idea. But, i don't think that's good design in a PVP scenario. Why does sniper deal almost no damage? No idea. Why would anyone even try to play the jetpack marine just to get instantly shot out of the sky? No idea. all in all, the versus is actually the worst part of the game. I can not recommend against it enough. It is really the worst part to this game and feels rushed and an absolute joke to say the least about it. Don't play it. The servers are horrible, the weapons are unbalanced and frankly some classes just don't belong there. PLEASE DO NOT PLAY IT FOR YOUR SAKE LOL.

Why is there no achievement for beating the game on Angel Of Death. Do you know hard that is. And you mean to tell me there is no recognition for it? Nice.

its a great game. Most definitely the one of the best in the series since Soulstorm, Dark crusade, Vermentide, Dark-tide. But, if you payed $89 or $100 for this game. You 100% just got scammed for the lack of content and replayability this game currently offers. I really hope this game gets more and more beef on its bones as time moves on but for now. Get ready for an experience you're only going to feel one time and never come back to again because there is nothing to keep you playing.",Recommended,3635,38.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

AjninDoC,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AjninDoC/,"The game itself is pretty average in terms of game-play loops, and content. It's probably one of the most polished games i've played this year in regards to animations, and fluid controls. The only reason i lasted this long is that the game portrays the illusion of power well, and makes you feel strong or accomplished by doing parry combo's properly. When crap hits the fan and you somehow manage to survive, it does leave a satisfying as heck feeling. Esp when you're matched up with randoms and everyone dies while you clutch parry shield spam your way to victory lol.

It just falls short of all marks that would make it a must buy. If one DLC comes out, and it offers more weapons, new modes, new peeps. 100% pick it up then.

Dedicate 2 solid hours to grind it as hard as possible, and decide if you like it. It doesn't change a crazy amount from 2 hours to the 13 hours i have at the time of writing this. Refund it if it doesn't tickle your in game power fantasy.

As a direct sequel to the previous one, this game also stays true to the gritty and hefty feel of being an astartes fighting impossible odds as you clash against a never ending horde of enemies in a desperate gambit for survival.
The game does a wonderful job with major set pieces, absolutely gorgeous visuals, and really sets the atmosphere you would get from your favorite Warhammer books. The game was definitely made for 40k fans in mind and it shows.

Mechanics wise, it feels very similar to the first one with its somewhat janky combat system and it's repetitive hack n slash feel. If you love that kinda stuff, you'll feel right at home. Operations and eternal war feel a lot better than the story gameplay wise giving you a variety of different classes that all have different play styles and limits of what you can do. The pvp is a great homage to the early 2000s style of run n' gun around the map without making it too complicated and honestly, it's a lot more fun and addicting than it sounds.

The game itself is a huge tribute to the fans of Space Marines but it's a mixed bag for anyone who is new to the universe. The game does not in anyway try to teach you what is what and who is who so prepare for some reading or YouTube videos if you happen to want to get into the lore. The game story is easy to digest and the combat on normal mode is very noob friendly but it's recommended to go through the story with a friend or two as it definitely makes the gameplay more enjoyable. Saber interactive hit the spot in getting the feel and soul of a Warhammer power fantasy and this is definitely one of the better Warhammer games. Do not miss this game if you love Warhammer.

Luckily, I read into the negative reviews and saw they mostly had that in common, and decided to give it a try. I don't normally post reviews, but I think it's only fair to add a positive one to counteract the unfair negative reviews this game is getting.

The pros (only playing Multiplayer COOP so far):
* You can join matches in progress and have people join in progress on you, so you don't need to worry about people dropping out.
* The missions are fairly linear, but it works similar to L4D2 where the locations of items and when enemies attack can be somewhat random.
* The AI direct is brutal but balanced.
* I don't see anything with an advantage behind a paywall so far. All cosmetics only really.

The cons?
* The learning curve is higher than you'd think with team dynamics. It takes time to realize what skills to bring, and even normal difficulty is brutal without the right skills and synergies in coop.
* It's sometimes hard to find games at odd hours of the day.
* I've had the game freeze during joining games on occasion, and the loading screens are a pain.

Overall, it's a bit of a grind and it's a little repetitive. If it had to rate it, I'd give it something like a 70-75%. I'd like to see more content, but I don't feel my money was wasted either.",Recommended,1117,69.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Go big or go home, right?

Space Marine 2 was the best pre-order I could have ever spent my money on. Even though this is a pre-release review, and there are some minor bugs here and there, Sabre still has time to polish whatever minor bugs there are before the 9th when the game is fully released.

As is now, Space Marine 2 feels like a 1.0 game even during the pre-release. Every 1.0 game known to man has always had it's fair share of minor bugs, and so does this game, but they're only minor at best. No game breaking bugs, or anything! I can absolutely say that this game is a solid 10/10 no matter how I look at it. Great job Sabre Interactive and Focus Entertainment!

Disclaimer: Space Marine 2 is a big game in terms of size and performance requirements. Please, do not read this review and bomb it, knowing that your rig may not be the best. Please reed the specs list for this game before you play it, as this game may cause rendering issues with lower end equipment.

1. Not the biggest fan of the balance of the new health/armor system in single player.
2. Fix it so we can choose not to join MP PVP games with 200+ ping - not having a settings for this in 2024 is ridiculous.
3. Way the tool tips are explained for parrying/dodging doesn't really line up with how the systems work in game and should be ironed out (It's not necessarily ""bush button when you see red/blue light"" - it's a little more nuanced than that.
4. The UI for armor customisation etc is just ♥♥♥♥ to navigate on PC and was clearly designed with consoles more in mind. Please fix this.
5. Some optimisation in frames and loading times would be good.
6. Some of the difficulty modifiers are a bit extreme especially on AoD level difficulty, especially playing solo.
7. Some minor bugs esp with how AI helpers behave.

That said the good things;

1. It's a blast.
2. Story is fun.
3. It's really gorgeous to look at.
4. Really leans into the grim dark.
5. Sound is great.
6. The way they've integrated the operations missions into the actual story is genius. I hope they plan more content along these lines.
7. With the way they've built it out I can see it being a game that has content coming for it for a long time.

Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10, room for improvement being in the things I mentioned at the beginning.

misiok1234,https://steamcommunity.com/id/misiok1234/,"This is in my honest opinion the best Warhammer 40k game we've ever had. It does a lot of things very well, and very little outright bad.

The story is good but nothing mind-bending. There's the usual 40k war drama. A few nice twists, and some truly breath catching moments. All of that is if you're a fan of the setting.

If you're not, or yet undecided, then this is a very good entry point. The game does an amazing job showing the scale of conflicts that take place in the universe. Then it impresses you with its visuals and sound design and does not stop.


Things of note, multiplayer (both PVE and PVP) have customization, and the story clocked for me at around 12 hours at the hardest difficulty. Performance seems good enough, though people mention crashing and CPUs going very hot, so keep that in mind.

The main story puts you in the thick of the bugs and lets you fight tooth and nail to complete your missions, the AI are so & so, but you can give them basic commands with the ping system. But will ofc recommend Co Op.
PvP seems like a fun feature wich adds some different content for the game.

Performance vise it has some issues. Seen a lot of others also marking that we are hitting pretty high CPU temps even with low loads on the CPU.
i run a i9-13900k so my temps are gonna be a bit higher, but not 85+ when the load is sub 50%.
This is probably because the game seems to enable CPU boost when it boots, i disabled this and ran then at 60C, but the FPS tok a massive hit, so changed it from Agressive to just Enabled.

EDIT: Seen an update when I got home from work, hoped crash was fixed, not yet. Also tried AMD beta driver 24.10.31.10 as recommended to try on a thread.

Didn't have this much fun with Warhammer 40K game since Dawn of War series.
DOW 시리즈 이후로 이렇게 즐긴 워해머4만 게임은 처음인 거 같아요.
Was a bit difficult until I figure out how to manage my health and armor, still hard as I'm working on switching between the weapons.
체력과 아머 관리를 어떻게 해야 하는지 감을 못잡았을 때도 어려웠고, 아직도 무기들 스위칭은 감을 모잡아서 어렵지만요.
But even if I take those stresses into the account, it's still very fun game to play.
그래도 저런 스트레스 요소들을 감안해도 여전히 재밌네요.

The downside is that it takes forever to load the game.
거슬리는 부분은 게임 로딩이 너무 오래 걸리는 부분이네요.
If it's single player only, I can wait.
싱글게임이면 그냥 기다리면 되겠습니다만.
But this eternal loading time also takes place in the multiplayer, which makes me LITERALLY into the eternal fight.
멀티플레이 때도 영원한 로딩이 걸리는데, 이거 때문에 문자 그대로 영원한 투쟁을 하게 되더군요.
By the time my loading is done, a next round is about to begin that I can't get back to the Battle Barge, and I'm in the next round selecting my class.
로딩이 끝나면 다음판이 시작되서 배틀바지로 돌아가지도 못하고 다음 클래스 고르고 있네요.

If there's a way to manage the eternal loading, I think this game is above the average game, and recommendation for Warhammer 40K fan.

Story: Amazing, compelling, and a throw back to the original. A lot of what makes this special is the adaption of new technology but with the frame of the original. Massive invasion as focal point with the hint that something more is happening just over yonder.

Combat: Great feel for combat has a BATMAN:ARKHAM feel but still sets itself apart. Parry, Perfect Parry, Counter, Heavy attacks vs light attacks and more. This game offers up just about any way you could want to slice up your enemy and a decent armory of weapons to choose from.

Online: This is where the short comings happens. They do have a PvE and PvP mode but both those are plauged by horrid netcode and optimization. De-sync, connection issues, and a general feel of lag plauges online scene like as if great papa nurgle himself plugged the lines with horror juices from the warp.


OVERALL: This game is a love letter to the original and 40K fans would love the army painter makes it to where you can express yourself in your armor any way you'd like and the combat system has its own place while still feeling familiar like other games i've played before easily transitioning skills. Once the first few major QOL updates release this game will be such a joy to play.(

FUTURE: Chaplin, Librarian, and Apothecary would be nice adds for classes.

Would LOVE a WAR mode where its 6v6 chaos vs space marines but with Ai being the minions of chaos and the imperium of man.

Would also love to see larger maps and maybe slower combat longer cooldowns for PVP so choices you make actually have to be thought out instead of every engagment being blow everything every time at every fight.(leads to stale and stagnent gameplay)",Recommended,1414,53.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Space Marine 2 is a brilliant and bloody hack and slash mixed with some Shooter elements that honestly I believe has outdone most other games that come out nowadays. The customisation is fantastic, Allowing you to really create your perfect Angel of Death in anyway you see fit. The combat is engaging, vicious, And rewards you well for taking the time to hone your craft in the speciality of death. And amongst many other things, The game is aesthetically pleasing in visuals and infrastructure.

One of my favourite things about this game is that It reminds me of the old Xbox 360 style of games, The UI and the overall vibe is reminiscent of classic multiplayer games that came out during those times and much like that era, This game simply allows you to just Play the actual game and earn things naturally. Not by paying for some stupid FOMO Battle pass system, Or greedy microtransactions, No. You actually unlock things and earn the rewards just by playing.

So far I have not played much of the Campaign by the time I write this review, But judging by the first mission and from what I've played, I can tell it will be a Good story to sink time into and uncover what Titus has to come up against.
Also, Bonus points Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive for allowing Co-Op Campaign, That is a feature desperately missing in several games now and It's something that needs to make a comeback. (Edit: The Campaign was a 10/10, Highly recommend it.)

If you're a Warhammer 40K fan, Lore nerd, Or even a newcomer, This game is an absolute treat to those who indulge in this glorious hobby and those that serve Holy Terra. (Emperor preserve that one fellow Black Templar bulwark I played with in PVP and commenced Phalanx shieldwall tactics together with.)

I have personally experience about four bugs total in the game, that a simple restart has fixed and thats with the four day early access, stuff I am sure they will clean up. My major complaint was that campaign missions felt too long, and thats a wild thing to complain about. Everything else is so perfect. Combat feels great, animations look amazing, writing is solid, every faction is represented so well.

I played through alone and with friends, and had equally as much fun both times. Towards the end of the game you gets some moments that are worthy of going on box art they look so good.

I found myself stopping often to look at the scenery, the background fights, and even just to look at the little NPC guardsman uniforms. It all was clearly made by people who care to represent warhammer right. I am still dissapointed Darktide has nothing close to these guardsman uniforms, and these guys and gals are literally background characters... wild.

Enough of the positive though. There is one major issue. Chaos customization in PvP is bad. Really bad. Each class is locked to a legion, and you cannot replace any armor pieces, and there is a handfull of options. It is a direct downgrade from the first game. However, the devs did say they were going to address this, so its hardly a negative, but if you are a chaos enjoyer, give it a bit before you try playing warhammer barbie with your evil bad men.

I highly recommend this, even for first time warhammer fans, its fairly easy to follow and watching like one video on the first game will give you all the context you need.

larshustler,https://steamcommunity.com/id/larshustler/,"Space Marine 2 is easily one of the top games in the Warhammer 40K universe. After 13 long years of waiting since the excellent first game, it was absolutely worth the anticipation. To be completely honest, I got my hands on it early thanks to the leak in July, but since I knew I’d be buying the full version (and went all out for the maximum edition), I think that excuses my impatience. I simply couldn't wait!

Campaign

The sequel’s story picks up directly from the first game, even though about 200 years have passed in the timeline. The campaign is as grand as you’d hope, fitting perfectly within the Warhammer 40K universe. Blood, gruesome executions, and limb-tearing battles define this world, and the game delivers on all fronts. While it’s linear and heavily focused on combat, I found the whole experience a ton of fun.

Combat Mechanics

The combat truly nails the feeling of being an unstoppable, armored giant. From the moment you start the campaign it’s clear that you are super-human. The Ultramarines stand out from the surroundings and look like some sort of Titans, with their sheer size making them equals to the Tyranid warriors. The weight and power of your weapons – both melee and ranged – feel spot on, especially when playing with a controller (I’m using an Xbox one). Each hit, shot, and headshot feels impactful, and those bloody finishing moves? Just perfect.

Co-op Mode

A great addition is the new co-op mode. After the introductory mission, you can jump into the campaign with one or two friends, and it works flawlessly. It really amps up the excitement of playing together. If you're playing solo, the AI companions are excellent, so you won’t feel left out.

Multiplayer

And now for the real treat: multiplayer. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer from the original Space Marine, you’re in for a treat. It was brilliant back then and kept me entertained for hours. Now, after 13 years, we finally have what we’ve been waiting for. The multiplayer alone makes Space Marine 2 worth buying. If you're into the Warhammer 40K universe, there’s no better PvP experience out there.

In my opinion, it’s a solid 10/10. Definitely worth checking out!",Recommended,1825,38.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 7
MasatoshiHamada,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasatoshiHamada/,"Space Marine 2 is a masterclass of game play, aesthetic and story adaption.

As a lifelong 40k fan I couldn't be happier with how the game turned out, its authentic and respectful of the lore, setting and relationships that have been crafted over the past 40 years, often we see games come out now with the dreaded ""millenial writing"" where they try to co-opt established franchises and write absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they think they can do better, however Saber have done an astounding job at faithfully creating a world of warhammer 40k the way it is meant to be done.

It's rare we get a down in the mud war game that is just big sweaty men beating other big sweaty men for 15+ hours but here we are, haven't touched the operations or PvP yet but the story and single player campaign alone more than deserves its asking price with how faithful and intense the story is to the world of 40k.

Even on my 1080, the game is smooth and optimized properly and doesn't rely as insanely heavy on modern gimmicks to have the game run smoothly and look great, it actually makes me want to upgrade to see it in its full glory.

I loved the original Space Marine game, and I recently replayed it, as I know that memory does not always reflect well, we do tend to have rose coloured glasses when we look back on games.

In comparison, Space Marine 2 has improved upon the original, as one would have hoped after 13 years. Obviously the graphics are now way superior. The game is much smoother, I hadn't realised how clunky the original controls were, but then when we go back and play older games, it is not unusual for us to find such things.

The Campaign mode is fun, and it is nice to be back as Titus once again, although 200 years later.

Multi-player has a very similar feel to the original, which is a good thing in my book.

I did find that the customisation menu for painting your own armour schemes is not as straight forward, but I eventually was able to replicate my own table top Space Marine chapter paint scheme, which made me very happy.

All in all I am pleased, and recommend this game.

76561198005587126,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005587126/,"Space Marine 2 is a game that is far, far better than Space Marine.

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.

zurkarlol,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zurkarlol/,"To me it's a mixed leaning more positive, I'm also making it a positive review as there's far too many review bombers nowadays that rate a game badly because of connection issues and not the actual quality of the game itself, but here's my personal reasons as to why:

Pros:
- Gameplay is VERY fun to me, I feel like I'm playing a slightly slower paced doom and I am absolutely all for it
- The devs absolutely nailed the aesthetic of every faction/race involved in the game
- The missions are memorable and the story is well written, it combines the main campaign with the operations mode so you can see another section of the story being told (cool concept imo)
- Gunplay feels nice and very impactful, some enemies feel quite spongey but it's to be expected of them, whereas the trash gaunts and such really feel like they're weak and puny compared to you as a space marine.
- Customizing your marines for operations and PvP is so nice, some minor things could be changed such as chapter icon placements on both shoulders instead of just the left, but past that you can make the chapter you want or even your own unique chapters and I love that!
- The game is a real power fantasy of being a space marine, nice.
- The classes are all very unique in their own ways and it gives you a sense of responsibility in a certain way? Like how a Bulwark will tank most of the hits for your team, a Sniper will target Majoris enemies that may cause your team issues, Vanguards will grapple around to enemies dueling them and so on. The visual aesthetic of each class is noticeably different per class too so you can really stand out if that's your thing.

Cons:
- Me personally, I've experienced a few bugs far between one another, the gamebreaking ones being the infinite loading and some are just a minoris (get it?) inconvenience such as cosmetics changing back to being a blueberry marine, no biggie.
- Campaign felt quite laggy as I went on through the missions, whether it's my CPU (which is well above minimum) or if the game is poorly optimized for CPU usage currently, I'm unsure, but time will tell.
- There really isn't enough content in the game to warrant the price tag, it's an absolutely beautiful and well built game, but considering the campaign length and the current 6 operations available in the game (which some mentioned will actually change each time, all they seemingly meant was item placement and enemy placements during the mission), now we are getting more content but that all comes next year sadly.
- The connection issues are reminding me heavily of other super hyped up game releases such as Helldivers, so fingers crossed these get fixed up before the full official launch of the game.

The game is a solid 7.5/10 currently, it has room for improvement but it has no real way to retain its playerbase, which frankly makes me quite sad considering how hyped I was to be a space marine in current year gaming.

76561199146330120,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199146330120/,"Gears of War (minus the cover mechanics) meets Dark Souls (minus the stamina)- that is basically the gist. I think this game is insanely good. There is a lot to like here and a completely different play style is involved in being good at it. To all the people who are saying the game is unplayable, it is because you are trying to play the game like it is something it is not.

Here are 10ish tips I use to play harder missions:

1- Don't try and run from enemies... it won't work. They will tear you to pieces while you roll or run away. When you get in the thick of it, you need to be able to keep smaller enemies back while engaging elite enemies. Tyrannids will die when their elites are killed near them, so killing an elite will wipe the mob. With Chaos Marines you should ignore the elites for the most part and focus on the mobs- the little humans can decimate you with their charged shots and the units with swords and shields are priority to remove.

2- Get used to parrying/dodging (like Dark Souls... kinda) and don't try to button mash your way through melee combat. Parry/timed-dodge give you room and open up attacks that do massive damage to single targets and can give you armor back. That is the way you play the game. All classes can hold it down in the thick. Some are better than others, but the only class that can break aggro is Sniper (cloak). Everyone else just needs to learn to hold it down.

3- If you are a ranged class, it serves you best to get near melee units when surrounded, let them get most aggro while you pick off.
3.5- If you are melee, don't leave your ranged guys behind too far. They are vital to controlling mobs and helping you bring down the ranged elites that make it hard to sit in the melee.

4- Don't be afraid to take a little damage to get off a big hit. Some melee charged attacks leave you vulnerable, but the effect of that attack is worth taking a little damage. It can stagger enemies and open them up to executions or one-shots that replenish armor. (This is especially useful for Heavy class when surrounded by trash mobs. Charge the stomp and take the hits. The slower attacks are not going to give you breathing room.)

5- Let ammo classes have the ammo when you are melee and let the melee classes have the health packs. Don't be the melee guy using an ammo pack to replenish your side arm with 10 rounds where it can give a heavy another 90. The heavy can do FAR MORE work with 90 than you can with 10.

6- Look around the maps after they are clear for pickups. They are often in green stacked boxes with labels on them. Roll into those boxes to reveal some choice rewards.
6.5- Use environmental objects to kill mobs. There are explosive barrels everywhere in the maps. Even if you are standing right by them, you can shoot them. Space Marines don't take much damage from friendly explosives of any type.

7- When you hear the weird vibrating wave noise and see the indicator that an elite is calling in reinforcements... target that character with headshots, heavy hits, or nades. It will cause the timer to end and it takes time before the enemies can call again. Don't let them call in reinforcements all the time. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH CHAOS MARINES!

8- This is actually one of the more important points I have: DON'T RUSH. Slow is steady and steady is fast. Everyone trying to rush ahead will get you split up or bottlenecked in an area that can make engagements too hard. While some missions or areas can be advanced while under attack, hordes can often move to the next area and be waiting for you, so you actually don't skip anything. THE ONLY TIME TO RUSH is on the last objective. You can often end the objective without having to clear all enemies.

9- A.I. is not useful in harder difficulties (ESPECIALLY SNIPER CLASS ***absolutely useless***). I wouldn't recommend even trying it. It CAN be done, but it is adding an extra layer of difficulty on what is already a difficult game. Just wait to pick up players. The missions can take a good 30-60 minutes to complete on harder difficulties. You can wait a few minutes more for a third.

10- Each class has a way to either keep up their ammo, or keep up their armor/health (some have both). Learn those tricks to keep you alive and get good at exploiting them. For instance: Bulwarks get all of the depleted health from their special the second it is used. You can turn all that health back in full if you can execute an enemy soon after. Sometimes it is better to get an enemy in an execute state, drop your flag and then execute the enemy to get all of your remaining health back... you don't need to use a heath pack.",Recommended,3802,41.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

If you’re looking for a game where you can turn your brain off and have mindless fun, become incredibly immersed in a world, and just feel like a badass all the time, then look no further.

This game and its core gameplay loop is fantastic. You’re equipped with a handful of things you can do like shooting, parrying, melee, etc. and it all meshes perfectly. The gameplay is smooth, weighty, and the game does as good a job as it can in giving you a taste of what it’s like to be a Space Marine. I’ve put almost a day in this game already and I’ve yet to feel bored or that it’s repetitive. This is because of simply how good it feels to kill things in this game, and it’s helped by its progression system like ability points and weapon upgrades.

The story is short yet sweet. Entirely linear story mode but this is said as a compliment. The game knows what it wants to be and it accomplishes it. The high moments of the story are memorable and those high moments triple down on the whole “let’s make the player feel like they’re unstoppable and cool beyond belief.”

Most of your time following the story, if you’re a a PvE person, will be in the Operations coop mode. Although the high moments in this mode don’t come close to the high moments in story mode, it is still an absolutely fun game to play.

Coming into this game I knew very little from Warhammer. I’ve dabbled in some of the Warhammer games but I couldn’t tell you anything about them lore wise. I say that to say if you’re new to Warhammer, this is definitely a game you can pick up and follow. All it’s done is motivated me to learn more of this universe.",Recommended,1344,51.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

I really enjoy this game but it def has its issues. I understand that the game just came out so things wont be perfect so im writing this as just some things that hopefully will be changed or touched upon in the upcoming updates and final release.

This game is a very fun but kinda clunky game. ive been playing with my brother and were having a blast but we have been experiencing some issues.

1. The resources in the game that allow you to customize and upgrade your space marine in my opinion are kinda hard and annoying to get. I understand that you gotta grind for them but i think that you dont receive enough of them after each mission.

2. oncoming range damage needs to be lowered a lotttt. I find myself entering a area and then almost instantly losing all of my health and armor due to playing a melee space marine. This causes me to have to dodge a lot and space marines dont really seem like the guys who roll around dodging everything like in a dark souls game. It just feels like im rolling around trying to get out of line of fire way to often.

3. That brings me to the health. The white health needs to be either removed or touched on. It lasts for almost no time at all so its very difficult to gain back the health you have lost in that time. Executions being the main way to get back health besides the stims i think is a really cool touch to the game. I think that having the executions heal a percentage or some amount instead of the white health bar would be a lot better for the game. (you could also lower range damage)

4. Parrying in this game is wack. i can either do it or i straight up cant. I also find myself parrying on a blue icon but just to get hit out of it by some dumb alien. I then proceed to get ganked and stun locked by everything. I dont know if this is a skill issue or not but something needs to change about the parrying in this game.

5. The ai in this game is actually laughable. Before writing this review i was in a mission where one of the space marines was using the sniper class. I watched as our man used up all of his sniper ammo on the small waves. he then took out his pistol after he ran out of ammo and would shoot the big guys. This literally doesn't make any sense. They shouldn't do this and they should also be able to pick up ammo or something. Also sometimes ill see them just standing while im fighting everything. They also arnt very focused on by the enemy and they almost never perform an execution.

Overall i really enjoy the game but i def see some things needing change in the future. I will continue to play this game with myself and my friends.",Recommended,2202,21.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

By the Emperor! It’s about time we get a Warhammer game with this level of production that is not a strategy game.

This game is an absolute blast, yes there are some graphical glitches and some performance hiccups however these things usually get patched up within the first year.

For the price of a $60 dollar game you’re getting an excellent campaign following the story of the previous title and its canon to the current setting of Warhammer. You are also getting some well polished cooperative missions that relate to the campaign in an intuitive way.

You can play every mode this game has to offer cooperatively, and that by itself is incredible. Everyone knows you can have fun with a “bad” game with friends but this is a great game with friends.

The PvP is pretty light on content and has some progression in the form of cosmetics and load-outs. The PvP is definitely the smallest part of the game however what is here is fun. It’s just one more way to spend some time in this setting.

Developers have said they intend to drop free content consistently with a roadmap they’ve put out. Cosmetics are the only paid DLC as of now.

The recipient of this message has been commanded to obtain relevant Space Marine 2 materials in order to purge enemies of the Imperium with holy fire.

A distress signal has been received of an imminent Tyranid invasion and it is your duty to hold the line! By His will, we shall not falter!

There have been reports that a marine under a black shield designation has made land fall and our Sanctioned Psykers have relayed that his missions command the Emperor's own gaze. To desert now would be an act of heresy and will be met with death.

You are expected.

We march for Macragge!

---------------------------------------
Secondary Message Received

Operations have been sanctioned by the Chapter master to assist in the success of primary operations. 3-Marine squads will commence imminently. Elite marines have been notified and will be provided with the Imperium's finest arsenal of weapons and equipment with opportunity to improve said equipment.
Only fools would miss this opportunity to spread the Emperor's will. No matter the odds, we will fight, we will persevere, and we will endure.

For the Emperor!

----------------------------------------
*DISTORTION* *SIGNAL FAILING* *PRIORITY ALPHA*

-----------HERETICS--------URGENT-------------ARCH-ENEMY FORC-----REINFORCEMENTS REQUESTED-------------

*END SIGNAL*

We have reports of Alpha priority Chaos traitor forces converging on locations critical to the Imperium. 6-marine squads have been sanctioned and sent. Scout reports suggest these are no ordinary traitors and travel in 6-heretic squads. this will demand every fibre of instinct to survive this mission.

Only the most daring marines will endure. Your sacrifice will be noted and met with the highest honours.

For the Ultra edition, it was not worth the hundred bucks. I'm just going to tell you that now, you get a few cosmetic items and some points but that's about all unless I bugged out and didn't receive what I was intended to receive

Review for the game so far
-The PVP in the game is kinda mid to me, kinda reminds me of Warframe PVP. On how, yeah, it's there, but it definitely feels more like a PvE game because of it's slow pace
-The graphics are absolutely adoring, I've caught myself on multiple occasions stopping and just looking at the blood on my armor, the trees, the mud, etc.
-The PvE in this game is really nice and funny. I'll be in the middle of a brawl against a warrior and a small boi will jump at me and it's like. ""Ight, hol on"". That being said, its well done and very entertaining
-The Guns are really fun to use too but I definitely feel as if the main bolter type weaponry is a lot better because of the cammo capacity.
-Another thing I love about this game is that you can feel the weight of your character, when you fall, roll, run, or even walk. You can definitely feel like our character is lore accurate heavy",Recommended,986,38.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

Performance notes
As a heads up though I will recommend putting this game on an SSD if you have one as there have been reports of some HDDs not being fast enough to load past the opening cutscene.

Ontop of that the render resolution options below Quality look blurry so I'd keep that setting on Dynamic, Native, or Quality

76561198119500182,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119500182/,"First off..... FOR THE EMPEROR AND SANGUINIUS!!!!!!!

As a long time Warhammer 40K fan, i was really excited to hear that we were getting a sequel to the first Space Marine. I was not let down at all. Space Marine 2 is a game that took the first Space Marines, 40K Lore, and modern day mechanics and made a great sequel.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Good.

The Campaign is fun to play with friends or even if you are by yourself. Having played both, they both run smooth and leave plenty of fun to be had. The executions do not feel as needed as the first Space Marine which gives the game a more open feel when it comes to combat. The melee system is great and while some may say that it is clunky... Your a space marine not a Ninja... The weapons are all great and i found myself having plenty of opportunities to choose a new one based upon what situation i found myself in. The story kept me wanting more and there was nothing that i felt was left out in the progression.

I never really found myself feeling as if I was playing something that was a filler. Everything in the game made sense and seemed as if it had a purpose. It would have been cool to have some missions where you were able to man some type of vehicle or heavy weapon but that's really picking at the bone.

While in a mission there was no loading screens that took away from the immersion. Which is something to me that I find very refreshing. I think that there's a huge emphasis now on open world games which takes away from the detail that's able to be put in from these types of stories.

The graphics are fantastic. I think that a lot of people are not looking at the minimum requirements prior to buying the game and are now blaming it on the game itself. The graphics require some beefy internals but nothing that goes far enough to render a newer 30 series any problems at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Not so Good.

While we are still on the first seasons and I'm sure that there is more customization to be had right now customization feels a little empty. Don't get me wrong I think that it's great that you can change your armor and add different styles to your character, I just feel as if it would be nice to be able to customize the actual character itself.

Along with the PvP customization feeling a bit empty I also feel as if the PvP modes feel a little bit empty now as well. It would be nice to have a little bit more room for some of the maps versus a very tight 3 lane system. I think that there's plenty of room to be able to play with this in the future, but I would love to see a more open concept with some of the maps.

I didn't have any glitches until the end once Titus was sent up off of the map and into an unplayable area this only happened to me once so I really wouldn't call it a bad thing, but it did make it to where I have to load from a checkpoint. Again, this is really nitpicking to try to find something whenever it comes to the game play itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, I think that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is a very fun game even if you're not a fan or knowledgeable of Warhammer. Especially for the state it's in at launch I believe that there is a lot coming to the game in the future that is going to keep fans wanting more and more.",Recommended,2982,39.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

merrill72688,https://steamcommunity.com/id/merrill72688/,"While Space Marine 2 is solid, a worthy successor to the first game, it suffers from several critical flaws that actually are steps back from the first in some areas.

First, in terms of weapon selection the game suffers from having too many that essentially perform the same role. 3 different assault rifles, 3 different marksman rifles, several carbines; each are only different to such a minuscule degree and perform the same function that they may as well not exist. It's not particularly exciting to approach a supply pod to choose from what is essentially 3 or 4 of the same weapon. This gun has 2 less shells in it, but does 3 more damage; this one has 5 more bullets, but more recoil! Who cares?
Second, the AI companions are frustratingly stupid to the point that they are actually a liability. On numerous occasions I've failed the objective because the NPCs would prioritize slap-fighting with a single termagant over defending a mission critical target or running out of the capture area to go melee a handful of minor enemies and leaving you to hold it by yourself, drawing all the enemy fire and dying. Worst of all, the devs seem to be aware how stupid their bots are as they have relics that can let you self-revive and the take-and-hold objectives only require the player to progress.
Speaking of objectives, defend the thing and stand in the capture area are two of the worst, most boring tropes to pull out of the generic game design hat. How is standing around in a highlighted area for 5 minutes w/ no cover fun? It's not, it's padding.
Then there's lack of polish is some areas. Like how your melee and primary weapon just vanish in your hand when your switch to them, or how if you charge your plasma pistol and swap weapons the plasma coils will continue glowing and stay inflamed on your hip, or how in a cutscene where some Cadians are burning a chaos tainted tech-priest their lasguns are shooting out fire because the devs forgot to use the guardsman model w/ a flamer. These are minor things, but noticeable.

The co-op and multiplayer is pretty good, but the fact you can't customize your chaos marines beyond colors is a joke. The 2011 game had more chaos armor customization.

It's a decent game, but not worth buying at the $80+ edition's price point and would be beneficial to just buy at $60 or wait a few years for a complete all DLC edition.",Recommended,1960,25.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

Took me 14 hours to complete the main campaign so this review is based only on that.
(there is a lot of extra end game content but i just rushed the story on 1st day because i was off work)

Its Glorious!

The Good:
Amazing visuals! The captured the atmosphere of the WH 40K universe perfectly. They did the same with S.M.1 so no big surprise, but with the modern graphics its a sight to behold.
I legit kept stopping throught missions to admire the level design and background views.

The Story was great and the ending opens so many doors for DLC/Expansion and 3rd game. But to be honest WH 40k lore is so vast and good they can keep pumping SM games till i die and they will never run out of material.

The Bad:

This part will probably temporarily.
Combat is a bit overtuned. Tyranid swarms get annoyingly hard to deal with especially because of their ranged units being the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooters in the universe. And the little Xenos doo way way too much damage and because Solo play AI is useless you can get overwhelmed in some fights.
I felt quite stressed during some engagements just because my squad wasnt helping so it all fell down on my shoulders.
But this can be fixed in a patch and with some damage number adjustments.

There are some miner lag issues ive seen reported, i experienced it only a couple of times where FPS would drop disgustingly, it usually ends itself but on my last mission it didnt and was so bad i just restarted the game and it was gone.

The crashes? I never had those but i heard its a thing.

All in all though this game is phantastic, im glad i bought the gold version to give them a few extra bucks.
I hope they continue to support with new added content as promised!

its a WH 40k love letter!
And if you like straight up fun shooters like Halo,Doom, Killzone, Gears of War etc you will have a blast with this.

sixbhg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sixbhg/,"Campaign is sort of criminally short, maybe an hour or two shorter than the original which was already not a long game. However, there is more variety in locations, biomes, and areas. A couple of questionable game design choices and areas, like a whole segment with one of the worst flamethrowers in videogame history.

Game still has some of the fundamental design issues of the last one, except magnified a bit because now fury is the only way to recover health outside of medkits and executions only recover armor.

Tyranid enemies swarm, are fast and numerous, and feel good to shoot at. They will however always close into melee barring some good chokepoints to shoot down, so get used to living on the edge between executions.

The other faction still completely shred you at long distance, so rushing them to try and get into melee range is the best strategy, and once again, you will have to get used to living on the edge between executions. Squadmates can revive you to make it somewhat less punishing.

The real meat of the game is the WWZ-like Operations mode, which they expect will keep people playing despite the campaign being short.

Game is very pretty and runs well. It's the best-realized vision of WH40k we have right now, so if you bought it you know why you bought it. Non-40k fans, maybe it's best to wait for a sale. All the same, to have a game launch with full campaign co op, a co-op class based progression mode with XP meters, and a multiplayer deathmatch mode in 2024 is a rarity, so it's worth giving the developer some props for delivering what used to be standard for a full price video game.",Recommended,1342,42.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

76561198036839698,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036839698/,"Space Marine 2 Review: A Colossal Tribute to the Emperor's Legacy

Graphics and Environment
Let’s get this out of the way: the graphics, while not the heart of a game, are absolutely stunning here. Every environment you march through is a feast for the eyes. The towering structures, massive landscapes, and the overwhelming scale of everything around you are crafted with such attention to detail that the world feels both epic and alive. This isn’t just a game of massive, empty spaces—each area is filled with intricate details that contribute to the narrative and the lore of Warhammer 40K. The environments themselves tell a story, pulling you deeper into this universe with every step you take.

Animation and Weight
The animations in Space Marine 2 are where the game truly shines. The fluidity with which your character moves, swings their chainsword, or unloads a Bolter is beautifully captured. Each action feels deliberate, grounded, and—most importantly—weighty. You are a three-ton walking fortress of destruction, and the game makes sure you feel every ounce of that weight. There’s a tangible sense of power as you crush enemies beneath your boots or charge headfirst into the chaos. Every animation, from the reload of your weapons to the way your armor clangs as you run, is executed with precision and adds to the immersion.

A Seamless Continuation of the Story
Fans of the original Space Marine will be delighted to know that the story picks up seamlessly from where the first game ended. It’s engaging, well-paced, and dives deeper into the rich lore of Warhammer 40K. Though the campaign may feel short, it is packed with intensity and emotion. The writing is sharp, with enough twists to keep you on your toes, and you never feel like a passive observer; you’re in the thick of it, commanding the battlefield.

Companions and Dialogue
One standout improvement from the first game is the addition of your companions. No longer do you feel isolated in your battle against the enemies of mankind. Your comrades are constantly by your side, not just in combat but in conversation. The dialogue is rich, filled with anecdotes and banter that breathe life into your squad. You’ll find yourself lingering to catch every line, reluctant to miss a single exchange. It makes the world feel more connected and the journey more personal.

Customization and Armor
The level of customization available for your armor and weapons is downright insane—in the best possible way. The care and love poured into the design of the armor pieces, the weapons, and their customization options reflect the deep respect the developers have for the Warhammer 40K universe. Every adjustment, every new piece of gear feels earned and enhances your immersion, making you truly feel like a warrior of the Adeptus Astartes.

The Bolter Experience
And then, there’s the Bolter. It feels like a Bolter—every shot, every burst of fire is satisfying beyond words. The sound, the recoil, the destruction—it’s as though the developers bottled up every fan’s dream of wielding a Bolter and delivered it in perfect form.

A Love Letter to the Warhammer 40K Universe
At its core, Space Marine 2 is a love letter to Warhammer 40K. Every aspect of this game—from the lore, the world-building, the massive battles, to the smallest details—shows how much the developers cherish this universe. It’s clear they took their time, ensuring that every fan feels the same reverence for the Emperor’s legacy while playing.

A Bug-Free Experience
As an added bonus, my playthrough has been nothing short of flawless. In an era where games often release with bugs and glitches, Space Marine 2 stands as a rare exception. I didn’t encounter a single bug during my time with the game, which in itself is a testament to the care and dedication of the development team.

Conclusion
This is more than just a game; it’s a triumphant ode to the Imperium of Man, a masterfully crafted experience that brings the brutal, dark, and magnificent world of Warhammer 40K to life. Space Marine 2 is a game fit for the Emperor himself, blessed by the Omnissiah, and delivered to us mortals with divine precision. Thank you to the developers for creating one of the best gaming experiences of 2024.

-I actually like that there are class limits. I couldn't imagine getting stomped or stunlocked by 6 assault marines even if it's a good meme. One of the few games so far where I think it made sense to lock classes.
-Armor customization is amazing AND I love that they give a few slots for you to make several custom outfits.
-Pretty simple UI. Took me a second

-Not much to put here other than a bit of server instability. Seems some people got hit hard with it, but I've only disconnected a couple times in about 8 hours of multiplayer.
-Armor customization is AMAZING, but sometimes it won't apply right away and you need ti force it to update by changing it around and then back.

UKMUNU,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UKMUNU/,"Space Marine 2 is just amazing. Visceral combat, amazing maps, a truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insane campaign with the added bonus you can play the whole thing in co op! The PvE operations tie into the campaign so as you play through you'll unlock all of them I honestly don't care there is only 6 of them, if you've played games like Darktide, V2, Killing Floor or L4D you can play through the same maps hundreds of times and never get bored because the gameplay is just that much fun. Eternal War is also very fun with its very fast pace and quick TTK

My only issue with this fantastic game is the campaign AI is genuinely the dumbest thing I've ever seen. They can't do objectives so you're juggling surviving against the hordes and doing them yourself but worst of all they don't prioritise defending critical objectives and they don't kill the most powerful/annoying enemies I have to do it so I've failed a couple of times because the AI is just not helping with the mission or killing things",Recommended,807,36.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 6
TallPaulInAustin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TallPaulInAustin/,"I cannot recommend this game for solo play, buyers be advised.

Terrible AI and bad objective design make the 'shoot the flying monsters off the thing' levels completely unplayable at higher difficulties and the rest of the game a slog of killing everything for your team while everything ranged tries to kill only you.

This weekend I will try to group up with friends and hope for a better experience but I hear there are problems there too.

Combat system is fun at it's core so hopefully co-op play and fixes to AI can salvage this for me but, be aware, solo play is painful at veteran+ and if you plan to play mostly solo, I would wait!

Edit: On my campaign I went back to Battlebarge, changed difficulty then beat the shoot the buzzards level even though all the weapon pick-ups were glitched after the diff change. The rest of the game seems to work fine solo save the enemies only shooting at me.

wanuboi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wanuboi/,"When a Warhammer 40K game is made by passioniates of the universe and the franchise it makes Space Marines 2. They understand that a Space Marine is heavy so the movement is heavy, but they also understand that those boys are geneticly modified so they have really powerful attacks. It's like RDR2 physics meet Doom Eternal. Exactly what i wanted for this game. Do i have to talk about this gorgeous artistic direction ? I mean everyone saw it and it's more impressive in game. Optimization is on point too, it's been a long time my PC was capable to get full ultra on everything + 4K resolution on a triple A game, and on this one i can, even with a setup made at the time of RTX 3080. For the gameplay part, it's great too, i didn't watch all videos cause i absolutly hate getting all infos on a game before buying it, i watch like 1 or 2 trailers and that's all. So i got really suprise that they went for World War Z type of gameplay, which is awesome considering we are fighting Tyrannids that comes in hordes. They even also implemented a part of the gameplay from Plague Tale Innoncence replacing rats with tyrannids ones. This game is well thought for what it want to be. I mean this game is filled with great ideas, love for the universe. Combat is really smooth too, having to block at the right time, to get a automatic shoot on a ennemy and then having to go on him to finish him with a brutal animation feels so good. With experience you can get really good at dodging and chain up parry to look so cool and impress your mates in the lobby.

Now for the coop part, there is 8 classes on launch, which is big. Each classes have their weapons, around 4 to 6 diffrent skins for each classes + A LOT of diffrent paints depending on which factions you want to represent (Dark Angels, Salamanders, etc), all of these are unlockables by compelting objectives. 8 differents operations unique for coop + all campaign missions playable in coop too and 3 mods for Coop. I mean content is already HUGE from the start. I really dont get how people are not rolling with extremly positive reviews about this game after the last triple A games being Star Wars Outlaws, they should support this type of games made we love. And what is even bigger is that the game will have season pass, new missions & DLC added on top of a game that feels already finish.

THIS GAME IS MADE FOR WARHAMMER 40K Fans !

PS : i have watch some negative reviews saying ""game is so good but ai teamate is not good so give this game negative review"". My god, me who tough they were to powerful. Yeah you can't order them anything, but damn, they are really helpfull and definitly shoots well, they are a little too powerful in my opinion. But if the only reason you give a negative review is because you can't give orders to AI next to the rest that is completly awesome, i'm just sad for the team of devs to count you in their consumers.

I've finished the campaign and have yet to start operations and PvP but the game is really surprising me so far even though I was doubtful to buy it at first.",Recommended,271,39.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 6
76561198009767820,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009767820/,"First off, I’m a huge Warhammer fanboy and i love the universe, i mostly play WH Fantasy.

The game looks very pretty and runs smooth, they nailed all the little details and made a very believable world, insane amount of detail made the world and environments looks astounding.

Sound design and music I would rate as very good, Gun sounds are meaty, Heavy Bolter should've had a ""heavier"" sound. Voice design and narration is good.

Story is good, very enjoyable. length wise. it's fine. Highest difficulty is a good challenge.

Multiplayer Operations are good, PvP is what i expected, same as the first game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some gripes i have with the flow of combat compared to SM1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tyranid medium sized enemies, from Warriors and up sponge ranged firefights and are mostly dealt with in melee. Except the sniper rifle and guns with low ammo count, the guns are intended to deal with hordes.

Melee is fun and fast but gets unmanageable when you are swarmed since you cannot turn and block fast enough, attack indications from small enemies are nigh visible. not all attacks from medium sized enemies against the player are highlighted, so you must pay attention to their movements, not always easy with gaunts chipping away at you.
Imagine any batman game the last 10 years, but more jank and unresponsive. you are often busy finishing an attack animation chain to make the guard trigger event.
you do not snap out of animations like a Fromsoft game.

Health and armour restoration is good, projected health loss can be negated by scoring kills.
i like the change from SM1

Customisation is primarily for multiplayer, no custom hero creator. (i did not expect this since Titus returned) You cannot outfit or command squad mate AI which to me seems like a HUGE oversight and wasted potential.
Star Wars Republic Commando comes to mind.

Spent some time to find a good K&M setup due to right mouse button being melee on any weapon, and not ADS.
i would have preferred left button attack, right button block/counter. and then a hotkey to toggle between melee and ranged making left button fire and right button ADS.
now i have to use use thumb button for melee, Q for block and space to dodge.
Believe the first game handled this better.
The swap between pad and keyboard is seamless and in real-time.

So far, a carbon copy of the first game. i think Orks would have been a better opponent. Tzeench enemies are kind of lame. personal opinion, somebody i'm sure absolutely loves it.
but it does not take away from the combat.

Technical issues and wishes for the future
-------------------------------------------
-DLSS 3.0
-Frame gen options
-Low latency options
At 30% Utilization, CPU 14700kf; running at 100 degrees with Windows power settings -> power boost enabled. 60 - 80 degrees in other games. Unacceptable.

-Keyboard shortcut to toggle melee/range needed so we can use the same binds on the mouse.
-crouch button
-customizable sight, very hard to see enemies at range due to huge crosshair.
-MP Operations needs to be shorter, you are now locked in for 40minutes.
-Regular gaunts are spongy, 3-4 shots with a bolt pistol/plasma pistol are too much. have you seen the calibre of a bolt round? they mist pretty much everything.",Recommended,2914,48.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

SkrubWizard,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkrubWizard/,"I may be somewhat partial, having been an avid Warhammer 40k enthusiast for the majority of my life, but this game has truly been exceptional. It retains the essence of the original while incorporating a contemporary feel. As a Space Marine, one genuinely feels like an indomitable force, with the bolters delivering a powerful impact as they rightfully should. The Tyranids are visually stunning, and the Gaunts evoke memories of the raptors in the long grass from one of the Jurassic Park films.

The worlds are visually breathtaking, and the level design scarcely feels linear. I often find myself immersed in the environment, captivated by the universe. The swarm technology is ideally suited for the Tyranids, although the animations are not flawless. When the Gaunts charge, there is a lack of variety that makes them appear less individualistic, but this aligns with their nature as hive mind-controlled entities.

Saber Interactive has excelled in creating a game that seamlessly fits within the 40k universe, appealing to long-time fans and newcomers alike. I eagerly anticipate what they will continue to bring to the table.

76561198885588747,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198885588747/,"Initial thoughts after 8 hours in the campaign:

Pros
It's ****ing amazing.
The melee is so crunchy and you feel like a total badass. Steepish learning curve though.
Campaign feels like peak Gears of War. Moving through a ruined city with living backgrounds and swathes of NPCs fighting alongside you.
The Battle Barge looks incredible, everything looks incredible.
The Tyranids are actually scary, not just cannon fodder.
Chaos forces are epic.
Voice acting is great.
NPC characters are varied and likeable.
Enemies are diverse and fun to fight, every battle feels different.

Cons:
This might be campaign only, but a good chunk of ranged weapons feel a little underwhelming for anything other than Hormaguants. I do appreciate in Multiplayer they level up and get better. I guess it's like Vermintide, you don't get a gun that does everything.
Melee is brutal at the start but the learning curve is nice. LEARN YOUR I-FRAMES.
Some minor graphic/clipping stuff. You can walk through your bot squadmates.
Veteran difficulty is stated as the ""intended experience"", but I think ""intended"" might mean ""with team mates"". Some encounter are gruelling as you get all the aggro and the bots just watch you.

Syphotic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Syphotic/,"This game is Phenomenal.

PROS;
- Full COOP Campaign and PVE Standalone Missions
- Massive customisation options which are unlockable through playing the PVP and PVE modes.
- Awesome Visuals and challenging gameplay at higher levels.
- The undying desire to protect those guardsmen as they're getting mauled by a huge swarm of nids.
- The tech from WWZ zombies has been brought into this game. Meaning the hordes will literally fill your screen and make you think ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, how am I going to do this""
- PVP isn't just reaction based, work as a team to win.
- The Imperial guards have been done justice, they feel how UNSC Marines felt in the earlier Halo games.

CONS
- No Widescreen support (this was outlined in the roadmap before release, though it should be included day 1)
- PVP can be a bit too punishing to start off with.
- Getting used to the menu system can be a pain at first (But it's nice it's all built into the hangar)

NOTES
Epic Services are installed to accomadate for cross-platform capabilities, The game is made with Unreal Engine.
The EULA exists, don't worry, they're not going to use it as an excuse to kill you like Disney.

-The game was fairly enjoyable with gameplay loop being repetitive, but rather enjoyable for the duration.
-Environments and graphics were beautiful and really made the experience feel like a proper 40k game.
-Weapons sound effects were acceptably meaty, especially compared to the 1st game.
-Difficulty was pretty decent on normal for a first run
-Enemy Swarm mechanics are amazing to watch and throw explosives at.
-Story was merely acceptable, akin to the 1st game or another shooters campaign
-Coop missions, while i have not played any at this point, seem nicely weaved into the main story to make it feel like there are other teams out there making a real difference.
-Campaign is fully playable in coop, however it is missing modern quality of life features, such as collectible sharing on pickup and ammo, health, and grenade pickups being limited to whoever picks them up first.

FinalLee_,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FinalLee_/,"Even as a newcomer to the Warhammer universe, I found myself irresistibly drawn into this game after just four hours. It effortlessly recaptures the magic of the PS2 and Xbox 360 era, combining a nostalgic vibe with electrifying action and satisfyingly brutal combat. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the gameplay is both straightforward and captivating, and the campaign delivers a premium experience that stands tall against other survival shooters like Left 4 Dead and Back 4 Blood. And I haven’t even touched the PvE (Co-Op) or PvP modes yet!

I’ll update this review as I explore further, but for now, it's a definite recommendation!

Update 1:

Having tackled the campaign on the Angel of Death difficulty, I must say the experience can be exasperating. The game’s extreme challenge often feels borderline unfair—enemies seem to have pinpoint accuracy, and defense missions inundate you with overwhelming hordes while your AI allies remain passive. While dialing down the difficulty may alleviate some of these frustrations, solo play on the highest setting can be incredibly grueling.

Update 2:

I recently completed the campaign in Co-Op mode, and it was a phenomenal experience! Despite my lack of familiarity with Warhammer lore, the game’s thrilling combat and grandiose interactions kept me thoroughly engaged. It felt like a nostalgic throwback to the golden age of 360-era co-op shooters, where teamwork and over-the-top action were the ultimate thrills.

Playing with friends is definitely the way to go. Although the game doesn’t adjust difficulty based on the number of players, managing a three-player team can be challenging due to some AI quirks. Despite this, the overall experience is a blast, and I highly recommend it for co-op fans!

Now I’m diving into the PvE operations—side missions that run parallel to Titus and his squad’s main storyline. While these missions often reuse maps with different objectives, the depth in the skill trees and class systems adds considerable replay value. Sure, optimizing your setup might will just be following online guides, the game remains engaging and enjoyable, making it well worth your time.

Final Update -

If you loved the Xbox 360/PS3 era of online co-op shooters, you owe it to yourself to grab this game—it’s essentially a revival of that classic style, now with a 2024 twist. It also boasts some of the best graphics to date, rivaling titles like Demon’s Souls (PS5) and Alan Wake 2. At $60, it might seem steep compared to the plethora of indie and roguelike games offering endless hours of gameplay, but the unique experience it provides is a rarity in today’s market. Don’t miss out on this gem!

Gameplay has been phenomenal so far.

The combat with the mix of ranged and melee was a bit jarring at first but now that I've play a little bit and have grown accustomed to it, I find it great.
The parrying and dodging can be hard to adjust to (if you're a little bit retarded like me) but it is well and truly rewarding.
The gunplay has been a BLAST. The guns sound crunchy and each shot has a good weight behind it.

In terms of optimisation; I am running an AMD 6700XT on Ultra and I haven't experienced any crashes or major FPS drops (only one minor FPS drop during the first mission).

I've only experienced one crash, and one time connecting was an issue. However the review isn't about the technical aspect because the game actually freaking worked instead of having massive amounts of problems.
This honestly feels as if im in the xbox 360 era again with gaming. It works, it's fun as hell, it feels like a movie and bad ass stuff happens at all times and it's just apart of the game. It's one of my highly recommended games in a long time and I can't stress the fun it brings. If you like smashing stuff, dodging, parrying, just plain explosive action. This game is for you.

76561198288692220,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198288692220/,"I was halfway through the opening level of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s campaign, unloading bolt rifle rounds alongside my two squadmates, when I found myself smiling at just how good it feels to be back in this futuristic grimdark fray. It’s been over a decade since the original, but Space Marine 2 reinvigorates the squad-based shooter series with seeming ease. The environments are varied and breathtaking, the running-and-gunning feels great, and the sense of comradeship while fighting with your team, be they bots or friends, can be exhilarating. It may not break much new ground in its genre, but it didn’t need to for me to have a blast playing through its dozen-hour campaign.

Let’s get this out of the way early: The original Space Marine clearly took inspiration from Gears of War, and this sequel follows suit. It’s a squad-based shooter starring heavily armored dudes who growl their dialog while either shooting guns or revving Chainswords to ward off invading aliens. The similarities don’t bother me a bit (especially when one could make the case that Gears borrowed from Warhammer first). It’s been years since I’ve played a game that scratched that particular itch, and Space Marine 2 uses the rich lore of Warhammer 40k to carve out its own identity. That’s true in both the meaty campaign that can be played solo or co-op, as well as two additional modes that let you upgrade your weapons and customize your armor between rounds, which are meant to keep you coming back after the credits roll.

297563215489,https://steamcommunity.com/id/297563215489/,"Its a pretty solid game and definitely worth it if you liked the original Space Marine. A lot of people are hate farming over ultrawide support(already announced that it's coming) and the optional epic connectivity for cross play.

While I will admit the game does use a good deal of power(CPU moreso than GPU from what I've seen on my end) its pretty optimized and sits comfortable at around 60fps even when huge swarms are on screen. I did have one crash when I was trying to close the game to go to work but haven't seen another since. I do have a pretty powerful computer(for transparency I have 3950x and 3080ti) so I cannot speak to performance on lower end computers.

As to the complaints about the campaign team-mate AI most of it is a skill issue on the players part. They aren't the best by no means but they get the job done, they shoot at enemies and will revive you if you go down. Overall the difficulty is pretty accurate to what the Warhammer world would entail and I've yet to see anything too cheesey happen.


TLDR: A bunch of fun and definitely worth it and as usual people are blowing things out of proportion either out of misunderstanding or a desire to farm engagement. I'll update this if anything major changes but it is a recommendation in my opinion.",Recommended,1050,33.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

I'm not much of PvP player, just because I suck at most games, but I will play from time to time. I also love the customization for the game, but hope they add more customization for the Chaos Space Marine side, I know its called Space Marine, but give some of us Chaos Space Marine lovers some love to.

Comments/Concerns:
Okie, I didn't play much more than the tutorial and a little more than part of the first mission and OMG it was fun! watching the cut scenes I felt like I should've turned the lights off and volume up 'cause Dolby Atmos and a large Format Monitor made me feel like you're watching a movie with how good it was :> The controls were awesome and I'd definitely recommend this game to a 40k fan.
My only concern is that the game doesn't support nvidia optimization tools, unless I messed something up when trying to set it up for the game.

All the bad reviews saying no ultrawide support neglect to mention that it was mentioned beforehand and they plan to add it by the end of the month.

MaksNCheese,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaksNCheese/,"I originally left a negative review (see negative review at the bottom)


BUT

after re-buying the game, I have changed my mind;

- Campaign is 10/10 -- very fun

- PVE mission are fun BUT very limited/repetitive -- need new missions ASAP

- PVP is nice -- movement still feels slow but you get used to it afer a while

BAD THINGS STILL;

- Lobbies are cooked, I hate the 3 lobby system; Servers keep disconnecting (probably will be better soon)

- Original opinion about the PVP armor customization still stands, I hate not having my custom armor because I'm randomly put on the heretics side in PVP

______________________________
I really wanted to like this game but --

- Forces you to install Epic Online services (Aka the store you open for the free game) -- I personally don't care but in case you do.

- I was hyped for the armour customization; however in PVP, if you are on the heretic side (''bad dudes'') you cant have a custom armour and you are forced to use pre-sets -- what's the point? let me use my custom armour

- The lobby system is cooked -- you should be able to select from the main menu (one button for campaign and another to join online lobby (PVE & PVP)

- PVE mode (aka operation) is cool -- must have a good squad/friends to enjoy. Random matchmaking is hit or miss (duh). You also cannot choose an operation unless you reached a point in the campaign (LET ME SPOIL MYSELF IF I WANT TO)

- In PVP Movement feels heavy/clunky -- yes, I know; heavy armours but the movement is tedious rather than rewarding. You die way too fast for how slow you move.

- Gameplay is fun as far as shooting and melee.

DISCLAIMER: The vast majority of negative reviews are addressing abritrary performance issues and are an almalgamation of indignation over the EULA and Epic Games. Be informed, that the negativity is not a critique of the game itself, rather an unnecessary agitation.

PERFORMANCE: My hardware is slighty above the recommended specs and the game actually performs a tat better than promised on the steam page. This experience is congruent with many other positive and influencer reviews. To all the people having issues: Be sure you have the correct hardware and given the month of the year: Maybe put ice on your pc.
The very first time starting this game you will have to endure longish loading times in the starting menu. That´s it.

GRAPHICS: Ridiculousy awesome! Not only are the textures and colours satisfying for the eye, the amount of detail on every Magos, on every Marine, on every console, the reflections, the scale and the monumental setpieces! I am loving it. This game could serve a Warhammer fan even as a walking-sim (though if it were one, it´d be too pricey). It is a joy to behold.

GAMEPLAY: Awesome cutscenes, great pacing and the rudimentary combos for melee, the cinematic parries and stun shots make for a better hack and slash experience than Vermintide or Darktide. The combat also feels Doom 2016 - esque.

My main complaint is about the MM and coop experience. Campaign is good, and short. PvP is fun, but unfinished - and I'll be honest, not my focus as of right now.

The coop experience is great when you have a full party, comms are the cherry on top. But due to the game being unstable and the absence of private lobbies, your Battle-brother will get replaced within the time it takes him to restart the game, resulting in a kick - which I'm again very sorry for.
Meanwhile, if you'd like to join or be joined on an operation, well, I have experienced waiting 10 minutes and no one joined in the pre-mission Battle-barge, and I have also spent 30, 40+ minutes on operations alone with 2 bots without anyone joining.
And the bots just don't cut it for certain missions past the normal difficulty, like being with somebody lvl 5 is enough to roll through any mission, but 2 bots just don't do enough damage to help you deal with the horde or the elites, resulting in you having to deal with both. You'll be able to do so most of the time, but you will sometimes fail because the bots will just die despite being unnaturally tanky most other time.
Again, the coop is really good, and I'm mostly neat-picking with the bots thing. But the MM is a real issue to me, especially given the price.",Recommended,1127,78.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

Backler69,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Backler69/,"If you're a huge 40k nerd like me, buy it. Otherwise, I'd wait for a sale. I've finished the campaign in ~8 hours which is less than I had been hoping for by quite a bit. Every mission except for one (rippers) was really great though. I was playing solo and the AI is really not very helpful with a lot of the bigger objective fights, but once I turned the difficulty down it became less of an issue, and it was more fun tearing though the 'nids that way anyway. On harder difficulties they really should've had you playing as a member of the Imperial Guard since that's more in line with the toughness level.

PvP is fun but weird. Frag grenades shouldn't kill a Space Marine from full health, and the overall TTK just feels off. Sometimes you die instantly, sometimes you get pounded and keep on fighting. At least one map also has way too much fog. Hopefully the balance will improve but, having played Saber's Evil Dead game quite a bit, I won't be holding my breath.

Operations is a stripped down 'tide type gamemode. It only allows one of each class, which means that if you want to use a specific primary weapon, you might be out of luck, and progression is several linear tracks. Each weapon has its own progression that unlocks better versions of the same gun. These require a resource you find by scouring each level for tiny little servo-skulls. These are incredibly easy to miss so if you don't get it and your weapons are already ""mastered"", you just wasted all that time. Add the fact that there are only 6 missions (I've seen some people say there are 8 but it only shows 6 for me), and it gets old real quick.

The customizations that are included are nice, but severely lacking. Especially for Heretic Astartes in PvP. They didn't even include every Legion! Things like patterns and emblems are way too sparse as well. Not nearly enough versions of skulls and the only options for pauldrons are solid patterns. Weirdly, one of the traitor Legions that they did include is the Iron Warriors, but NOT with their trademark chevron patterning. They're just a dull green-grey that's barely different from the Death Guard who are also missing their trademark mouth-gut. I have a feeling that most of these gaps were carved out as future paid DLC.

Hopefully they'll keep improving it and adding more content beyond the cosmetic-heavy road map but Saber has never been shy about pulling the plug on continued development, so we'll see.",Recommended,2015,26.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

My initial reservations about purchasing the game were regarding its longevity. Was there enough to do? The campaign supposedly offers 10-12 hours (which seems a little slim), but it appears there is a pretty meaty system in the coop missions outside the campaign. Multiple classes, skill trees, and weapon masteries should allow for many more hours of fun and progression outside the campaign. The PvP mode may not be for me, but it's an added bonus for those that are interested.

For many years I am single, and in true, I never had a girlfriend even though I had some ""sorts"" of relationships. My friends and family from time to time keep asking me when I will find a girl, specially my grandmother and aunt. I am 23 years old, 24 soon enough

I answered my grandmother by saying the following words: ""In these dark times, there is only war, and the Emperor calls his followers and children to fight for our survival, our right to live and to also fight in his truly name"". She didn't understand and said ""João what are you talking about, you have diabetes you can't go to war"".

""My honor is my duty"" - I replied - ""And my craft is to kill"". She looked at me thinking I was joking, maybe even crazy, as my grandmother looked for earphones with me thinking about the possibility of me talking to my friends - how naive.

I gave up talking to the beautiful girl that lives nearby, because the flesh is weak. I gave up increasing my work hours because money is temporary and blinds the men. I gave up all my dreams because there is no world for me where the emperor is not in it, and therefore would be no dream to follow in such a place anyway. I even stopped masturbating since I must spend all my energies and fix all my thoughts for the Imperium and humanity's future alone.

Now, the tyranids are attacking and I must answer the call, my call.

CptErrors,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CptErrors/,"Yeah, it's purging time - John Warhammer

Man was i worried about this game, thankfully, and to my surprise, it's pretty damn awesome.
Space Marine 2 is Space Marine 2, nothing more, nothing less. exactly what we needed.

The combat system is relatively interesting, with a large variety of enemies.
The game is faithful to the lore and has great scenes and environments.
No pandering, no woke racism, no woke ""diversity""

just pure Wh40k action. which is a phenomenal feat to achieve in 2024.


The performance is pretty stable, it's worth noting that this game is pretty CPU intensive.
running it with a RX6800XT putting all graphics settings up to high does not change the performance.
running on a Ryzen 7 5800x. lowest fps i've gotten is 55 on the most intensive scenes.

The game currently supports FSR2.1 and allows for dynamic upscaling resolution to maintain
good framerates, which might come in handy if you have a lower end gpu.
however, hopefully FSR3 support will be implemented.


Some people complain that the game prepatches itself with epic online services, which is required for crossplay.
This is already in many other multiplayer games with crossplay, but it advertises itself on first launch, so people see epic and then get mad. you don't want something with epic in the name running on your pc? turn off crossplay.
As for the EULA? it's illegal, just like so many other EULAs these days. accept it and move on.",Recommended,1205,16.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

If you don't know anything about the Warhammer universe, this game can be a good introduction to it.

A fantastic experience, I feel it captures very well the brutality and chaos of the 40K universe. The combat is pretty intense and visceral (the chainsword is truly something else, being able to hack n slash Niddies is very satisfying)

After playing the previous title when that came out and now getting a refresh but with new concepts, old familiarities and foes is fantastic. they even added similar things from the old eternal PvP that they shut down.

Looking forwards to seeing additions to the game and bug fixes and tweaks, there were moments i felt it/things needed optimization/s.

If you missed old-school games where you just played the game, it's for you. There are no absurd skill trees, open worlds, or other BS, just pure game. I missed that.

If you don't know about Warhammer, don't worry. You don't need to know anything about it. But I would recommend watching a short recap of the first game because it's direct sequel.
the negative reviews are absolutely retarded. Epic services is for crossplay, restart your pc if you're crashing (common sense), an fov slider isnt a requirement and its not worth refunding your game for, but it would be nice to have. AND TAA IS NOT FORCED. USE NATIVE AND IT DOESNT CHANGE ANYTHING.
the only fair complaint is no ultrawide support, but again thats not really game ruining but can definitely be a disappointment.

Mixed on release because people are valve shills who hate epic, or they're too stupid to read or reset their pc.
I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider. I know you want us to feel like big hulking dudes right in the mix, but letting us pull out JUST a little bit might be good so I can see more of the big beautiful world of Warhammer.
Currently waiting on PVP. I'll come back with an update... but for now, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

EDIT: I have a lot of hours played, and I wanted to clarify that it's a lot of grinding. You don't have to do it, obvious, but if you want to get everything, it's a long fun road. If not, campaign + operations 1x each is probably about 10 hours give or take.

Moreover the multiplayer part of the game is crafted very well. PvP modes are short so it feels refreshing to play multiple rounds back to back. The fact that, there can only be two of each class present in a match makes it very balanced as well since every class has their advantages and weaknesses.

- Single player campaign was somewhat design for co-op play. Having to do ""protect the objective"" or crown control short range and long range enemy units with the help of the Ai feels odd at times. (playing on the second hardest difficulty)

All that said, I still recommend this game. The game play is solid, the world design is very faith full to warhammer 40k and the grimness of the entire thing is well represented. (Expecially if your a Tyranids fan).

My only detractors so far after playing more of the game is that while PVP has been quite fun Operations has been borderline unplayable... I'm constantly stuck in infinite loading screens having to quit out and try again. This has gotten to the point where I haven't played a SINGLE operation. I'm sure this will be fixed but it really hurts my impression of the game. PVP doesn't have much issue for me but the lobby system isn't the best and has some bugs where I will have to quit to title as the ""press U to leave"" does not appear or work.

Gothferatu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gothferatu/,"An improvement upon Space Marine 1.

Faithful to the source material, very cool story, very cool visuals, a wonderful Warhammer 40k experience. In an era of fumbling AAA developers and companies only interested in money, not fans; this game does it all right. If you like Warhammer 40k, this is a great game. If you know nothing about any of it, it's still a really fun game. Your armor feels strong, your weapons feel powerful, and the world is very immersive. I've seen the roadmap and it will keep me playing, the multiplayer loop is decent enough that it doesn't get too boring too quickly, but with new editions every so often - I can see it being a good time.

100/10, GOTY worthy.

Story can be seen as a fairly typical Ultramarines one, but it genuinely shines bright in this age feeling almost like a blast from the past. Only wish it had more set pieces since the small amount of gimmick set pieces that are there might unironically be the single coolest 40k stuff for a shooter/hack and slash. Combat is fluid and hyper aggressive. You regain health primarily by killing things before your contested health can fade.

I think it was a very bold choice to launch with 3 maps for the PVP multiplayer however, and not bold as in good. However the PVP multiplayer is ALSO amazing fun, half the community for this game is larping as space marines in it as well.

BlueStealth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueStealth/,"Posting review as a PC player who has only spent time with campaign and operations, as PvP does not interest me in the slightest for this game.

Overall, this is a very solid game. If you are very into the Warhammer 40K universe, or you are open to Co-Op/PvP gameplay, this game is worth MSRP. If you are only interested in the single-player campaign, I would wait for the game to go on sale for something at or under $40 US, as the length of the campaign is not worth MSRP prices. The game has its share of problems, but the enjoyable gameplay more than makes up for those faults. Steam currently has this game at an 80% positive rating, and I think that is a pretty fair assessment of where the game is in September of 2024. I do wish the game had more content (I don't count cosmetics as content) and polish at launch, but I will give credit in that this game's launch was better than most others, lately. All things considered, I do not regret purchasing at this time.

Pro's
- Looks great graphically
- Fun, well-paced combat
- Writing is very good, barely anything cringe and no IRL political agenda's being pushed
- Very good attention to detail in terms of Warhammer lore adherence, etc.
- Great atmosphere, about as immersive as a Warhammer 40K game has been, for me
- Nice diversity of weaponry and armor customization

Neutral's
- Controls are ok. Certain actions are made awkward by sub-optimal controls (i.e. scoping ranged weapons with mouse 3, weapon switching with v). Could be better, but could be worse. Controls are playable, but likely need manual adjusting to be good for most players.
- Number of graphical settings for PC is nice, though most have little to no impact on actual framerates, which is a possible indication that the game or the engine it runs on is not as optimized as it should be.
- Class balance probably needs some work. Certain classes such as Sniper start out weak, while others are effective all the way to lvl 25. Not bad enough to be a 'Con', but not good either.

Con's
- Mediocre framerate for my hardware (4090, 13900, M.2 SSD, latest drivers, etc.). Framerate, even on lowest graphical settings, usually sits in the 60's for me. Needs to be in the 80's to feel fully 'smooth' for high-motion shooters like this one. Needs work.
- Campaign is a bit on a short side, and there are only 6 missions available for Operations. Makes the game a bit shallow, in my humble opinion, and will likely not hold people's attention for a long time. Campaign replayability is low, so Operations is really all there is for end-game content.
- Needs an FoV slider. Just a few extra degrees on the FoV would make the game feel a lot better, for me. For a third-person shooter to not have this in 2024 is a bit absurd.
- Game installs Epic Games' API service on first launch. This should only happen if the player goes into the game settings and enables crossplay with EGS (if its not an option, it should be). And more importantly, the game should be thoroughly tested to work in all other areas fully, without this being installed, which has not been done.
- Getting this game to start up normally and make it to the main menu has been more of a headache than for any other game I have played this year. Sometimes the game starts up, sometimes it doesn't. There seems to be multiple bugs caused by things such as Steam Overlay, the EGS API service, and others, that make even getting to the main menu a frustrating and inconsistent experience.
- Possibly the worst Con for me, or the least excusable, is the matchmaking. The biggest problem is that matchmaking will commonly only find 1 other player for you to play with, and won't fill up the 3-man party. The developers MUST add a feature to expose your current party to the public matchmaker queue, so that you can always go into an Operation with a full 3-man. Its not a problem due to lack of players, it just doesn't work correctly in its current state. There are other problems as well. For example, the matchmaking should not add you to an in-progress party, when a member of that party is playing the class which you have selected. This is basic sense sort of ♥♥♥♥, and its clear that the matchmaking is basic in its execution and thoughtfulness, probably due to the devs having to cater to the lowest common denominator, being consoles. The devs can, and should do better on this.",Recommended,3599,34.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561197973664724,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973664724/,"Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 review:

The genre could be classified as a horde shooter game - feels like it's leaning very heavily towards this genre

I only played Space Marine the previous game for a few hours because I was put off by the rather sluggish movement.
I was hoping for Space Marine 2 to be different and a bit more fluid and my hopes were fulfilled.

I am not into Warhammer lore and I know very little so this review is focusing on the game itself and is ignoring WH40k lore-accuracy.

While the graphics are stunning, I prefer playing on low graphics as with every game (I would exchange low latency and crisp gameplay every time over good looking graphics and screentearing)

Be that was it may, I am now 57 hours in having a blast.

The game offers a albeit quite short (only 6 hours as of offical playtime) campaign, but the game feels more focused on the online aspect such as PVE and to a less extent PVP.
I will skip PVP completely in this review because I didn't buy it for PVP but mainly for the PVE mode.

Neither do I intend to play PVP nor have I bought this for PVP.

PVP just feels like a slug fest to me and that's about as far as my experience with PVP goes.



You have 4 difficulty levels in single player and in the online PVE mode which is called Operations
There are only 6 levels so far for operations, be prepared to run the same maps over and over to level your character.
There should be new maps coming with future updates and a 5th difficulty level as well.

Which brings us to our next point:


There are currently 6 characters in the game which each specialize in a different combat role.
From Tactical (scanner that reveals enemies), Heavy (lets bullets rain while tanking) to a Sniper (that can go invisible and conventiently aggro every enemy on your teammate - because that's how most people play Invis Ults apparently ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
There should be a class for everybody to find his most favorite playstyle.

As for the difficulty, some people say it's to easy (mostly those who use out of whack weapons such as Melta) or on the other side of the spectrum people who can't cope with the melee combat of the game.

Which ever spectrum you fall into know this the melee combat is a very interesting part of the game.
Mechanics such as dodge (apart from feeling satisfying to dodge a incoming attack at the last second you get a slomo sequence which let's the player land a free shot on a target) to parry (which is the more interesting part for me personally, because parry is where the skill ceiling is at) - perfect parry also gives you slomo sequences that are called Gun Shot - free shot on target) and executions (Doom style brutality executions - ripping arms, tearing heads and cracking skulls that sort of thing)

Now if that last sentence alone doesn't convince you that this game is blast to play let me make another point why you should consider this game.

A horde mode was promised to be released in the future which sounds like fun.

No details are known yet I am afraid - I don't know if this will be more leaning towards Operations Mode levels or just endless horde mode.

There are tons of options to customize your space marine for different legions - those customization options are limited to Online Modes (PVP and PVE).
As far as I am aware you can't play Singleplayer as a different legion other than Ultra Marines.

So with that said, let the emperor guide your chainsword toward your enemies annihilation

For everyone else, here's what I'll tell you: Space Marine 2 is a game chock-full of love and attention. It is well put together and plays well, the campaign gives you a straight power fantasy, while the pve is a legitimate challenge. I do not really do pvp, so look to another review for that. The tone of the game is serious, with dry humor fitting for the characters and setting and the writing is perfect for the universe it is set in.

SkebbZ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkebbZ/,"First off, they really nailed the setting, atmosphere and general aesthetic of the 40k universe.

Overview
The campaign picks up where the last game left off, with a time jump of about 100 years into the future. The tutorial is used to bridge the gap between then and now, without explicitly telling you everything until the reveal at the end of the mission.

The campaign is good fun, and will take about 8-10 hours depending on how much you scrounge for loot and collectibles. It can be played fully alone, or in Coop with up to 3 players total.

The additional PvE MP/Coop content consists of several missions that tie into the campaign, and they all happen in parallell to your main story. Here you don't play as Titus, but can choose a class (armor type and gear) as well as customize your Space Marine quite a bit. You can paint individual armor parts, apply decals from various chapters, etc. This content is probably what the developers intend as the main time sink after clearing the campaign, and their road maps show additional missions on the horizon, as well as a horde mode.

The PvP content is not really that interesting to me, but it's there if you like that sort of thing. It has a bit of classic MP feel to it, and let's you play as traitor marines for the opposing side in various mission types.

In general, this game plays a bit like a cross between God of War/Doom/Darksiders. It's generally corridor based, with a few open areas in between. You are usually punished for playing too defensively if the enemy has ranged units, as the only way to recover shield without hiding behind cover is to perform executions and quickshots on stunned enemies.

The boss fights are usually testing your coordination and multitasking abilities, as they will force you to alternate between blocking, dodging and clearing adds while continuing to deal damage to the boss.

Ammo is scattered around, but with a full human player team it might be neccessary to swap weapons intermittently to avoid shortages.

While the story and exposition keeps you interested, the gameplay loop can get a bit stale if you don't play with friends and have a laugh on voice.
Ultrawide monitor support has been promised in a patch this month (September 24), but for now we play with black bars on the left and right...
No HDR support sadly, but the Nvidia overlay can apply RTX AI generated HDR as a filter, which looks pretty good if you tune it.
Some are locked behind a battlepass, but no gear/equipment as I understand it.

Get it if you enjoy the 40k setting and have a blast with the campaign. If you have friends to play coop with, you'll get some extra playtime out of the game.
Don't get it if you can't deal with the hybrid melee/ranged combat, which is a neccessity to survive.",Recommended,2298,10.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 12
76561198009867155,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009867155/,"TL/DR: Space Marine 2 is a great co-op 3rd person shooter/hack n slash that will be loved even more by fans of Space Marines and the 40k universe in general, 8/10.

The only thing I find to be wanting is the content; the entire campaign is great but the ''operations'' game mode really does need more meat on it's bones as 6 maps will get old fast, even with the combat being as fast, frantic and fun as it is. I'd also prefer it if the devs allowed players to choose whatever class they want to be rather than only allow 1 class per mission as it's quite annoying to be trying to get progression on one class only to be forced to play another. Customization is good, weapon choice is good and there's a class for everyone be it the versatile but generic tactical marine to the ranged focused heavy marine to the melee focused stalwart marine.

Hopefully the devs will keep expanding and refining Space Marine 2 into a larger, broader and meatier experience. I have hopes that Space Marine 3, if it ever happens, leans more into being your own marine within the Astartes, in a co-op setting, but with more varied co-op missions that incorporate procedural generation to some degree, I mean, if you took this game but crossed it with Helldivers 2, with you and your friends being part of a 3-4 man kill team from the Deathwatch chapter, rocking up to new planets and fighting any number of 40k factions for any number of reasons, this would be an easy, EASY 9.5/10 right off the bat, even with it's class system, 10/10 if they did away with the class system and just had the class abilities as wargear.
So, fingers crossed for the next iteration of the game being a more diverse experience. but as it stands, if you love 40k lore and the Adeptus Astartes, you will love this game. It's not perfect, but it is a good and true representation of the 40k universe and lore with solid gameplay.",Recommended,1545,13.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

Lemanicus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lemanicus/,"Thirteen years waiting and I can say its a solid banger of a game. In order:

Gameplay: 9/10 - could do with some more variant executions but is overall incredibly satisfying once you begin to learn the way you want to play

Coop: 8/10 Its a remarkably thrilling experience to be able to party up with your battle buddies and coordinate on Angel of Death difficulty against challenges. But it's cap at three brothers is quite disappointing. I dont buy balance issues, but i believe narrative hook problems.

Cinematic Experience: 10/10 visually stunning and involving with setpieces that while sometimes confused in delivery never fail to wow me with their intricate vision. Its a technical achievement to be proud of and truly a power fantasy simulator. I felt every moment and detail that was lovingly applied to this game.

Service: 1/10 Live-service will always be the worst way any game can be delivered because a game that can be taken from you and desupported is not a game you own, its one you rent on a lease.

Story: 6/10 This part is going to sound harsh, but thats just passionate opinion and wordiness speaking. I love the game, but it lacks a bit of daring. While not a bad thing, it is almost a direct, beat for beat retread of the original game and plays itself far too safely in the comfort of being both a retread and a power fantasy. There is true vision and the clear affection of careful hands on this game which makes it a little more disappointing that it doesn't dive deeper into it's characters or it's setting.
It over-archingly loses what has allowed the best Black Library novels to be so successful and that is the ability to paint a human face on the absolutely inhumane and unimaginable cruelty of the setting. A key part of that is bludgeoning its myriad characters with their own mortality and the visceral doom that pervades all things in the 41st Millennium.
At no point did I fear for these characters. At no point was I afraid that they would fail, because they never fell victim to the most human parts of space marine psychology. What makes 40k's child soldier post-humans so compelling *is* that they are elevated child soldiers with scars deeper than just flesh and bone destroyed by shamanistic surgeries; that they are Imperial heroes is itself an indictment of the Imperium. But they have so little to work against or see their brutalist ideals rebound off of. Threats are hardly threats because the game is an unfaltering power simulator. I think a greater balance could be found in delivery, in character and making you feel superhuman through the horrors you endure not just vivisect with a chainsword.
To this end the perpetual doom of the Imperium and this setting never really grace this game. The themes of endless sacrifice to a meaningless cause never really resonate, nor the futility of noble defiance. Theres never a sense of loss, or an emotional lingering made long enough for weight to settle in. Which is understandable, because very clearly this ontop of a sequel is a way to get your friends into the setting, not my wish for deeper story telling. Still, its a criticism nonetheless.


All this said; I had a great time! Titus, Chairon and Gadriel and Varrellus, Saarkana, The Brother Chaplain and all these other characters were little sprinkles of delight and I thank the Devs greatly for sharing them and even more for the absolute talent of every actor and voice actor.

8/10 Overall - I've more than got my moneys worth and Ill have more, I'm sure. Absolutely worth picking up and playing!",Recommended,2947,42.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 11
GreenTable,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTable/,"!NOTE THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW! if you played the first game SM2 plays similarly with a few additions here and there. Since there's three parts to the game at the time of writing its best to rate them individually

Campaign: Excellent set pieces, the maps have good variety. Combat mostly occurs in open arenas which often have multiple levels but ambush waves can occur on transit to said arenas. The story is decent enough with the presentation being A+ tier hitting on all the themes you'd expect from the Emperor's Finest, the game play however has large spikes in difficulty between normal to veteran with angel of death being nigh unplayable without extreme planning with a full squad as even mobs become bullet sponges with some basic enemies taking a full mag to down. In addition your AI companions arent the brightest bulbs in the closet having odd behaviors that need some ironing out but with playing with your mates resolves a lot of these issues.

Multiplayer Modes: Quick foreword, there's a distinct lack of QoL features within the modes ranging from friends lists to simply saving skins between mode swapping. You have been warned.

PvE: Unlocked after a few missions you run through the sidestories that occur during set campaign operations. Here you have access to the 6 classes which you are able to customize your looks and loadouts and spend tokens/exp earned to unlock new items and class perks. While mostly good there are some major balancing issues that Saber need to look into adjusting between weapons and classes but it works well for the 6 maps currently available.

PvP: Okay here's where things get a bit more negative. While fun at the time of launch there are only 3 MAPS! Additionally the balance between classes is hilariously bad with Vanguard and Sniper being auto picks and Bulwark not far behind. Its clear that PvP was on the low for priorities and it suffer for that. Between instant kills to spawn camping its really simple stuff that could be fixed if they payed more attention, hell if you look at the chaos skins they are just Tacticus primaris armor with spiky bits on. Cheaters are also a common occurrence and the game has only been out for a few days, which is expected but THERE'S NOT EVEN A REPORT FEATURE IMPLEMENTED! I'm hoping Saber irons this out because this mode will be dead within a month if they don't jump on it

Overall its a faithful if not rushed sequel to the original game, it can be played casually as a pick up game but the difficulty curve is harsh. If you're a 40k fan this is a must pickup otherwise I'd say give it a few patches for Saber to polish this gem up. 8/10",Recommended,2180,61.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

I will say, however - this game is SIGNIFICANTLY better when in co-op. It is designed as a co-op experience first and foremost and the AI bots at your side when playing solo are... uninspiring in their performance.

xariann,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xariann/,"This is one of the best Warhammer 40k games.

As an experience I can't fault it, as shown also by the amount of people who just RP casually while playing Operations.

From being called ""Brother"" to matching the party's chapter etc., you can tell a game has nailed the universe when people get invested.

The game doesn't try to bend Warhammer to be ""slightly less Warhammer because someone might get offended."" It also just tells the story it needs to tell straight to the point and without having a heart-to-heart talk every 5 minutes. You might or might not like the plot, but that's subjective. Having said that, the game doesn't try to be offensive either. It's just true to lore, no nonsense and just tries to be a fun game. Nothing more, nothing less.

The only politics you see are the ones sanctioned by Emperor within the Warhammer universe.

Combat wise the game requires practice and skill expression, and that's great, but some mechanics need some tuning.

Matchmaking is rather clunky at the moment, with parties disbanding when people with the same class are put in the same lobby (you can't have the same class in Operations). Picking a specific mission is not a guarantee that you will get to play it, as the leader of the lobby can change it in the Battle Barge. This game should take a page from the Mass Effect multiplayer's book, i.e., let people decide whether they are hosting or joining someone else. And also allow people see what others are playing before they get through several loading screens and can actually start playing.

There is a lot of stunlock here, and some enemies don't seem at all phased by your weapons in certain circumstances where they should. For example, when you land with your Assault, and there is an enemy that is mid animation, it should be interrupted and staggered. Instead they finish their animation and you get hit while landing without recourse. It doesn't matter that a flying human tank has just landed on them, with a thunder hammer to boot.

The reward for a perfect dodge is a counter shot. The gun shot locks you into an animation and zooms the camera really close to your character. Yet, you can get stunned out of that animation, which turns the reward for a perfect dodge into a punishment. If you are going to lock a player into such a long animation and obscure their view of the surroundings, you should make it so you can't get interrupted. It's a reward for dodging perfectly, which becomes meaningless if you can get punished.

There are other instances of this kind of mechanic where regardless of your size compared to the enemy's, regardless of momentum etc., the AI wins and you stumble around and can't react.

You use requisitions for almost everything, weapon unlocks, cosmetic unlocks and perks. I understand that you'll want to use requisitions for weapons. But their perks cost requisitions on top of the time spent leveling them or the data tokens you pick up in missions. If I am paying with time or the data token, why am I also spending requisitions? The same goes for the class perks. I am earning levels but I also need requisitions to unlock the talents.

The game is grindier than it needs to be with currencies that overlap in function.

Weapons need some balancing, as a lot of the bolters feel underwhelming, but I understand that balancing cannot be done easily within the first few days of launch, so I'll give the devs the benefit of the doubt here.

I know I spent most of the review talking about things I don't like, but the game has generally great moment-to-moment gameplay and, like I already said, great atmosphere. I still recommend it, but I just wanted to make people aware of some frustrations they might encounter.

aztec_again,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aztec_again/,"I am so happy we got a sequel for this IP. However, there's just one thing I'm very disappointed at with this game.

For the first Space Marine game, the base FOV was so low, that Titus' bulky a$$ was covering 1/4th of the whole screen. It made my head spin so bad, I couldn't play the game. As far as I remember, there was either no option in-game to change it, or there was but the max was still too low. I had to download a mod from Nexus mods to change the FOV to 90 or above. Thankfully with that, I was able to finish the game.

When I heard of Space Marine 2 in development, I was hyped as f***. I even bought the pre-ordered gold edition. When I tried it in Advanced Access yesterday, I was a bit disappointed that, even in a 2024 game which even has ""Accessibility"" settings, there's STILL NO F.O.V. SLIDER.

prballa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/prballa/,"As a 40k player and fan for 25+ years, I will try to be as unbiased as i can about this game. That being said if you are a fan of 40k, this is a game to get.

So far I have only just finished the campaign and looking forward to the multiplayer side of it. Having played the first game back when it was originally released on PS4, and the PC port, this game is much better. The melee combat alone is an incredible improvement although getting the parrying and dodging down was a bit tough. What I thoroughly enjoyed about the game though is that this one actually FEELS like you are in the 40k universe and in an actual 40k battle (at least how I imagined my tabletop battles would go). From the small little side bar conversations to the scope of the buildings, I think they nailed it.

As far as the story goes, you can tell they didn't really rely on the roster of writers Games Workshop typically goes to, so just keep that in mind. This is not a Gav Thorpe or Dan Abnett level of story, which is OK I guess but yea they could have made it a bit more interesting.

If your not a 40k fan, still worth a play through if your a fan of hack and slash with a lot of shooting. It is also pretty challenging game on Veteran Mode.

Lastly, although the developers said you didn't need to play the first game to be able to understand the story of the second, I feel like that was not an honest statement. Sure, maybe you didn't need to play the first one to get the basic story (which is really just bad alien invasion, kill aliens, unleash another evil, and kill that evil while trying to convey a tale of battle brothers) but in order to actually know the overarching story and the bigger picture, you should absolutely play the first one.",Recommended,1406,17.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

Pedwinget,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pedwinget/,"The games good. Definitely a solid addition to the library. -BUT- it does fall short of the original in quite a few ways. When it comes to the online pvp play they removed a lot of things that made for more meaningful customization of loadouts. Perks are gone entirely. Additionally it does not matter what class you play, all exp earned adds to an account level that just unlocks things for all of the classes when you level up enough. Winning Vs. Losing seems to make neglible difference, experience gains are marginally different. No achievements to chase that lead to weapon or perk unlocks. This also means a lot of the weapons will eventually be rendered useless against other potential weapons, IE chainsword without the life steal perk? Useless, might as well just go thunder hammer every time. Also some weird minor nerfs they slipped in, IE no more stomp attack for the heavy class, you just get no way to deal with melee when they are on top of you, and the assault marine jetpack has a longer delay when you jump up, and you have to hover in the air and hold it for a second to do the ground attack, which just means everyone and their mother will pick you from the sky immediately. Melee also feels weirdly wimpy compared to the first game. Thunder hammers used to kill in one hit, now it takes 3. The sword is just non-stop swinging. Meanwhile sometimes you get hit by one bullet and just die. Overall though, great game, just feels like its lacking some of the essence of the first one.",Recommended,1229,63.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

The campaign is somewhat longer if you play harder difficulties so your mileage will vary here, with my run on Veteran lasting around 10-12 hours, but length is not indicative of its quality. This is a pure power fantasy game through and through, and if you like older style brawler/beat'em up games, it feels like just the right amount of nostalgia with modern flair.

All base games cosmetics in Operations can be earned for free by playing the operations, with DLC being purely cosmetic packs for chapters and successor chapter heraldry, which nowadays is (VERY SADLY, it's downright depressing) not common. This mode also has an extensive skill tree for each class (which arguably some classes could be little stronger) but they mostly all feel very good to play in their respective roles.

I have not tried PvP yet myself but I've mostly only heard good things, just don't have an opinion myself here.

A lot of fun, highly recommend. If you've played Space Marine 1 then you'll know what to expect. Story is bog standard and the maps are fairly linear, but the graphics/art design, enemy design, effects, sound, animations, voice work and overall grimdark feel are all spot on. Combat is chunky and finishers are a work of art. Surprisingly challenging even on easy/normal difficulty. Shout out to the absurd amount of customisation you can do with armour pieces, paint schemes, iconography, heraldry... and the customisation is per class so you can go nuts with it. Limited Chaos Space marine options unfortunately for us heretics.

PvE mode is set up like Dark/Vermintide or L4D. You run through a map and can optionally collect extras for various unlocks, xp gain etc. A little repetitive at the moment but time will tell if the live service model delivers.

HauntingQuill55,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HauntingQuill55/,"So far so good!!!

As a die hard Warhammer 40000 and Horus Heresy table top/hobby fan since child hood, this game has really hit the mark.

Space Marine 1 was a blast and needed a worthy successor and this game has done it. The Lore is fantastic, leading on from Space Marine 1 and carrying on Titus's story. Performance is smooth, graphics are awesome, setting is breath taking and the game play is fun and gripping and fairly easy to get the hang of after a few keybind changes (this is only in the story mode so far iv not tried the rest of it)

The range of enemies (currently small ish) has captured each enemy type very well, for example the different Tyranid Bio forms etc. this adds to the game play experience with variety and flavour. The weapon variety is also great and the audio, man its good.

So far this game has really exceeded my expectations, with the current market of games being swamped by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remakes (looking at you COD) and bad entries to the franchises (looking at you HALO and Battlefield) not to mention battle passes. This game is a breath of fresh air. Its a good start point for anyone interested in the hobby and world of Warhammer 40000 and id highly recommend people follow on from this game and look deeper into the NEVER ENDING sea off lore and stories and even play the first game too.

Im sure this review will be changed/edited in time with new additions and stuff being added to the game and what path the Devs choose to go down (RIP HELLDIVERS 2), but i cant wait to see what is to come.

As it stands so far i give this game a 9/10, not full marks as the music how ever epic is so loud you cant hear you self think and the initial keybinds are a bit crap. But other than these 2 minor things, for me this game is epic.

Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating return to the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K

What a game!!! I am a huge W40K fan and absolutely loved the first Space Marine game. To say that I was psyched to hear that there was a sequel being made is a huge understatement. This became my most anticipated game of all time and I am incredibly happy to say that it has completely lived up to my expectations. Simply put, I love every second of it so far.

There was a massive flaw in the first game's single player campaign that always bothered me. I didn't feel like I was part of a massive ongoing war around me. There were orcs coming at me and there were fights here and there involving NPCs, but overall I did not feel like a part of a large war campaign but rather a small squad taking on the entire ork army.

Well brothers, forget all about that. This is war! I was blown away by the sheer scale of the set pieces and battles constantly surrounding me. And it just kept on getting bigger and better all the way to the incredible grand finale.

No technical issues on my end so I can't comment on that but the game itself is one of the most fun gaming experiences I have had in a long time. And the multiplayer customization is just staggering.

Can't wait for additional content and the Horde Mode!!! Gonna be playing this game for a long time.

76561198362588403,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198362588403/,"I'm going to give it a thumbs up solely for the campaign and how well it follows up from the first game while sticking fairly true to the characters.

Multiplayer as of the 9th of September just does not work. The load in time is literal minutes, i have the game on an SSD, and have great internet, so it is the games servers. Even if you do get into a squad, the load can freeze on another player, so theyll have to quit their game, then youre stuck waiting 5 minutes for their replacement to load in. Kinda sucks to pay extra to only be able to play the campaign a few days early.

Over all its basically more of the first game, but it looks nicer. The combat system is a little different, and it does work (the parry follow up shot never gets old) but I dont love the health system. I found myself multiple times hanging back waiting for my armor to regen, as, regardless of how careful you are, the swarms will chip your health away if you melee. Blocks dont really work unless the enemy has a blue bar, and you cant keep track of 30 enemies encircling you.

Because executions can now only be performed on large enemies or specifically stunned small enemies, and now ONLY heal armor, not health, you can die very quickly if you arent careful. I dont mind that, it makes it interesting, but the lack of healing makes the game play towards a more reserved, careful style. And that just isnt how I want to play as a 9 foot tall killing machine with a chainsaw. One of my favorite parts of the first was jumping into the biggest group of orks and cutting them all down. Youd be constantly taking damage but with the execution heals, you could pull it off with a little luck and a bit of skill. You ""can"" still do that here, its just a lot more luck based, or requires slowing the combat way down to stun small enemies.

The graphics look stunning. The game, of course, runs perfectly well on my 4090 with everything set to max. It does use the card substantially less than other modern releases, like Ghost of Tsushima. It also runs much cooler than those games do when under full load. So it seems very well optimized, and I presume it would run very well on older systems. I only had one instance of stutter and it was during a gigantic swarm.

The swarms are incredible and one of my favorite parts of the game. I saw a cinematic swarm in the distance, and took a pot shot at them for the heck of it. To my amazement, it actually connected. As it turns out, aside from a few in the extreme distance, each swarm, including many that you dont even interact with, are individual enemies. I assumed that the swarm fights were basically a spawner with a certain enemy kill count, and then they would all despawn. Nope. Theyre just a huge bunch of enemies, and the attack ends when you kill every last one of them. If youre fast enough, you can kill the swarm before it even climbs the wall. In smaller areas enemies will run past you through a vent or something, and they arent there for show. Those are real enemies, running to a choke point, that you can gun down before they make it there if youre quick enough. That helps make the world feel very alive, nothings really there as dressing. Theyre all things you can attack, because they exist in the game.

The AI is quite decent. I only had a team mate get stuck one time. They arent just there for show. They are so helpful in fights that I would rely on them, just like real human players. There were many battles I could not have survived without them. They fight, and fight hard. The enemy AI is lethal and surprisingly smart. I had two moments where I was watching an enemy group, deciding how I wanted to approach them. I assumed I was out of their agro range, as they hadnt moved for several seconds. Then one of them presumably *saw* me and alerted the others. I was not expecting anything more than simple agro circle enemies in this game. That was a pleasant surprise.

Aside from multiplayer, everything feels really good. They have great attention to detail, even down to the voices changing whether you put them in a helmet or not(if only they could be toggled for the cut scenes..) Cut scenes without controls are rare, unlike the first, even during elevator rides you have full control of your character. That helped me stay plugged into the game and limited frustration.

Over all, I would recommend it if you really liked the first, or like space marines in general. As someone whos never played the table top, but casually enjoys the stories and books of big armor guy go brr, theres a lot of cool lore moments and little secrets you can uncover.
The campaign is about 10 hours, and the broken co-op missions are only going to give you another 4 or so, if they ever fix it. At the moment, its pretty bare bones for $60, but most of the game that is there has a high level of polish, and its warhammer. This is certainly the 40k game I was hoping for, and I couldnt think of a better sequel for the first game. No character assassination, no politics, no messaging, no micro transactions, just chain sword. Very pleasantly surprised.",Recommended,4164,22.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

theKOTL,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theKOTL/,"CAMPAIGN AND PVE MODE REVIEW
At its core, Space Marines 2 is a fast-paced third-person shooter with an emphasis on tactical combat and cooperative play. The gameplay is refined from its predecessor, featuring:

Combat Mechanics: The combat system is both fluid and engaging, blending cover-based shooting with dynamic movement. New weapon options and abilities offer a greater variety of tactical choices. The game’s arsenal includes everything from rapid-fire plasma rifles to heavy-hitting boltguns, and satisfying melee weapons that pack a punch (especially during executions).

Squad Dynamics: Teamwork is central to the gameplay, and Space Marines 2 introduces a more sophisticated squad management system. Players can now issue commands to AI teammates with greater precision, and cooperative multiplayer allows for seamless coordination with friends. The synergy between different squad roles, such as assault, support, and sniper, is crucial for success in the game’s more challenging missions. The operations are a blast!

Progression and Customization: The RPG elements have been expanded, offering a more intricate progression system. Players can level up their characters, unlock new skills, and equip various upgrades. The customization options are extensive, allowing for deep personalization of both the player’s marine and their equipment.

Graphics and Audio
Space Marines 2 boasts impressive graphics, utilizing the latest technology to deliver highly detailed textures, realistic lighting, and fluid animations. The game’s environments are visually striking, and the alien worlds are particularly noteworthy for their imaginative design and scale. The visual design of the Tyranids and the Chaos Space Marines are incredible.

The audio design complements the visuals with a high-quality soundscape. The soundtrack is epic and immersive, featuring a mix of orchestral and electronic elements that enhance the sense of grandeur. The voice acting is top-notch, with well-performed character dialogues and convincing enemy vocalizations that add depth to the narrative.


On my older PC sporting a 1080TI, Space Marines 2 performs admirably. Load times are quick, and the game maintains a steady frame rate even in the heat of battle. However, there have been some reports of minor bugs and glitches.


Six missions available with a nice range of difficulty. All feel like additions to the campaign. The missions can be done with bots or other players but offer a nice PvE loop for those than don't enjoy PvP but still want to customize their Space Marine.


Space Marines 2 succeeds in building upon the solid foundation of its predecessor, offering an engaging blend of tactical combat, cooperative gameplay, and rich storytelling. While the game does have a few minor technical issues, its overall experience is both thrilling and satisfying. Fans of the franchise will likely find much to enjoy, and newcomers will appreciate the game’s robust mechanics and captivating universe.


NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GRINDING! (IMO)
Enhanced combat system with diverse weapons and tactics
Deep squad dynamics and cooperative multiplayer
Visually stunning environments and effective audio design
Rich storytelling with expanded lore
Great customization system


Minor bugs and performance issues
Some missions may feel repetitive
Stale PVE loop with the operations
Score: 9.0/10 - A worthy nomination for GOTY!

More content to be dropped with updates such as a Horde mode, another level of difficulty, and more!

Visually stunning, outstanding graphics, immersive, audio perfect. Everything looks and sounds the most 40k possible...

BUT

- Load times are atrocious (Game is installed on an M.2 for me) Fixed in hotfix.
- Game is unstable and crashes somewhat regularly Fixed in hotfix.
- AI squadmates in the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN are borderline useless, and there is no command system to order them to attack, protect you, move, etc. It's clear they expected you to play co-op with other people, especially on the harder difficulties. In a single player campaign.
- Operations are designed around PvE co-op, which is fine, but there is no option to play solo with bots so you can experience them at your own pace. Private servers announced.

Will definitely change the review if these issues are fixed. I was in xeno-purging heaven for the first 5 hours, but then the crashes started and the uselessness of the bot AI in campaign started to become a problem.

Honour is all, brothers. I said I would change my review if they fixed the problems, and the major ones have indeed been corrected for me. They even released a patch to optimize CPU useage and keep the temperatures down. There are still several balance issues that need adjusting, but I can now recommend Space Marine 2 to anyone interested in the IP or the genre.",Recommended,1119,31.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Angel of Death difficulty. Awesome game! ""Embody the superhuman skill and brutality of a Space Marine. Unleash deadly abilities and devastating weaponry to obliterate the relentless Tyranid...


Pros:
Beautiful graphics
Immersive 40k world
Good FPS on max settings (90+)
Good story, well written
Challenging and engaging combat
Singleplayer, PvE, Co-Op and PvP game modes
Good save checkpoints

Cons:
Mid replayability
Many crashes, stability issues and bugs
High abnormal CPU temperatures (85c+)
Frequent online disconnections mid game
Poor enemy reactions from melee hits
Repetitive mission objectives

Space Marine 2 is a significant leap forward from its predecessor graphically. The environments are richly detailed and the grim and dystopian atmosphere of the game is especially noteworthy, creating a sense of immersion that aligns well with the 40k universe. The battles are extremely bloody and gory, which make the combat feel epic and desperate.

The gameplay revolves around a blending of 3rd person shooting and melee combat. This sequel adds new weapons, new abilities and new customization options. It also introduces a much more focused approach on multiplayer with its reward system for the Co-Op, PvE and PvP game modes. The replayability of the game consist of completing the game on higher difficulties, finding all the collectibles and hidden lore scattered throughout the game. Unique PvE missions can also be completed only through the online mode and a PvP mode is available for the more dedicated players.

Overall, the game is stunningly beautiful, improves upon the prequel and has engaging combat. The story is well written and is a worthy addition to the 40k universe. Whether you are a longtime fan or a newcomer, the game offers a gripping journey into the dark and war-torn future of Warhammer 40k.",Recommended,1879,52.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

I'm currently running it under the minimum recommended and its mostly fine. No overheating minimal rendering issues unless there's so much going on it only renders the tyranids and no one else which is perfectly fine since im UNDER the minimum recommended on the hardest difficulty.

10/10 will continue to get clapped by a speedy bug bastard.

The combat feels clunky when I forget about combos BUT when I remember ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does it go vrooom although the AI teammates CAN NOT perform at this difficulty and tbh I feel like they cant perform on anything above normal since you cant tell them what to target and they will get stuck in a corner and pounded to kingdom come untill they are saved or you die.

5/10 better than doing this ♥♥♥♥ solo.

The game looks amazing even on the ♥♥♥♥ graphics I have it running on while under the minimum recommended (I will be fixing this in less than a week but i didn't want to wait that long) Never crashed and as stated above rarely turns people/bugs invisible when they aren't men't to be. Another issue I saw alot in the discussions was overheating which unless iv been playing for more than 8 hours without a break I haven't seen it normally.

10/10 cant wait to fry my pc on the highest graphics

I probably missed something but if it was bad and I forgot then it probably wasn't that bad and if it was good and i forgot then it was probably what you'd expect.

Pros +
+ Music and sound.
+ Graphics are pretty amazing.
+ Actually has a fair bit of content to do.
+ Campaign is actually really good.
Operations are fun and feels good to level up your perks for the different classes.
PVP classes are balanced around team work and it shows.


I'm not a massive fan of such a low amount of PVP maps.
PVP matchmaking sometimes has issues.



Thoughts; I'd like to say I was shocked about this game, I didn't really think it was going to pan out, I thought they would butcher it and it would be in my Steam graveyard. Now that I have some time with it I can honestly say it's really well done. They have 6 CO-OP maps and multiple difficulties for each CO-OP map, which is called Operations, within Operations you can level your weapons and classes. The Eternal War is the PVP side of the house and has 3 Maps and has 3 gamemodes, a roaming capture the point type, a traditional capture three static points and then my favorite by far is just TDM where the most frags win. They DO NOT record your statistics at least not right now but people aren't used to that and tend not to play the objective. You get so much more XP for your Veteran Rank in PVP so it feels like you progress through unlocks faster than the PVE counterpart its pretty crazy even loses are rewarded with comparable XP if you do well. The last part of this three piece chicken wang basket is the Campaign which you can also play with two friends or use the bots they provide. It's a little short but in that little bit of time they actually hooked me with the characters.

Really well done and I can't wait to see where they go with this.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved:

Sound Mixing: In some areas, the sound is oddly mixed. For instance, there might be a huge battle in the distance while the immediate surroundings are silent. Hitting enemies in melee sometimes produces little to no sound, which feels strange. Additionally, your teammates' guns are nearly silent, which breaks immersion. The sound mixing definitely needs attention from the developers.

Campaign Navigation: It would be more convenient to jump straight into a campaign mission without having to navigate the ship, take elevators, and talk to people beforehand. A skip option to go directly to the mission-ready screen would enhance the experience.

Offline Mode: It would be great if offline mode allowed you to earn XP and points to progress your character and unlock armor and perks.

So many coop games just put you in first person mode and expect you to shoot your way through hordes, this game lets you parry and dodge and block and execute and snipe ranged enemies and use so many different variants of tools available to you that it seldom feels like it's the game's fault if you ever feel like you are falling behind.

For the combat, the game requires actual thought when it comes to attacking enemies in melee. Mindlessly smashing the attack button without any thought will result in you getting punished by an enemy attack. Unlike other games where close combat is dumbed down to glorified a QTE like the Assassins Creed series. Space Marine 2 requires you to recognize enemy movement and attack patterns similar to games like the souls series. Contrary to what some may think, Space Marines are far from invincible (lower difficulties not withstanding).

Xtersin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xtersin/,"The majority of negative reviews are knee-jerk and reactionary at best. The game does not force you to install Epic Games Launcher, it just asks you for an account for crossplay since Focus probably don't have the resources of, say, Activision or Sony.
The EULA is the same that games have been using for the past six or seven years. If you aren't a fan of this one, I've got news for you about the stuff you've been playing. :/
For crashes, lower graphics.

The game itself? So far, it has been sublime. Melee combat has been greatly expanded upon since the first game, with parries and blocking making their way into the game. Shooting feels good and the bolters feel very satisfying to use, although I wish that the sound was a little lower in pitch. Would make it sound a lot more chunky, I think.

Fighting Tyranids is a lot more fun than fighting the Orks in the first game; fighting the bigger warriors first is actually beneficial this time around since, if a Tyranid Warrior falls, the Synaptic Shock will cause all the smaller buggers to die as well, which gives you another approach to dealing with enemies. You can wave clear like normal or engage the leader in a glorious melee duel.

The main bad thing about this game are the AI companions that kind of refuse to shoot at anything that is currently beating the hell out of you, which may get a little frustrating on higher difficulty missions, mainly with objectives that are more complicated than your standard 'kill enemies in area'. That's what the Co-op is for, though. The co-op is fun too, I've spent a great deal of time just customising my Bulwark.

PVP is very nice with a much lower TTK (Time to Kill) than one would expect. Gunfights are actually rather short and you cannot reasonably take on the entire enemy team alone without good positioning and the element of surprise. Whilst it IS 6v6 players, you cannot queue up with more than 3 players. If you have a fourth friend that wants to play with you, you're going to need to get very lucky with the matchmaking.

tl;dr: HIGHER DIFFICULTIES SUCK WITH USELESS AI
YOU CANNOT GO INTO CO-OP WITH THE SAME CLASS AS SOMEONE ELSE. NO INTERCESSOR / BULWARK SPAM.

Kodyd194,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kodyd194/,"One of the best Warhammer games we have gotten in years, easy to recommend if you are a fan of third person action games. You have the main campaign that is playable single player or co op, the operations mode that takes you through a few co operative side scenarios, and you have the PvP eternal war game mode. The campaign is between 8 to 10 hours long and the side content can mostly be done in a few hours, The game expects you to repeat content to get the most out of it.

The only major problem I can see with Space Marine 2 is that it launched with a fairly low amount of consent for a modern release. I definitely would have wanted more PvP maps and Co Op missions. This may be remedied in the long term, I know we are getting a few more missions and maps from the roadmap, and I also know we are supposed to get a Horde mode early next year.

Probably the most faithful 40k adaptation I have played to date. The environments are breathtaking, with beautiful set pieces. The voice acting is also great (although I find a lot of the space marines have similar sounding voices, so sometimes it's hard to tell who is talking).

The combat is fast and visceral, but it does kind of get old after a while. Once you've seen a handful of execution moves, you've seen 'em all lol. Sometimes when there are large swarms of enemies you can't even really tell what is going on and just kind of mash buttons and hope for the best. Some of the boss fights are also a bit tedious and tend to drag on. It can also get kind of clunky when you are trying to fluidly move from one combo or execution to the next, and the models kind of snap into place awkwardly, or environment stuff gets in the way, etc. I found the dodge and parry mechanics a bit cumbersome, but might just take more getting used to. I also find it weird how you can't execute enemies from behind, their model will just snap forward and do the scripted animation. Ah well, not the end of the world. The gunplay leaves a bit to be desired as well, which kind of sucks as 40k has some awesome guns, but it's not terrible by any means. Experimenting with the different weapons is a lot of fun, and there are plenty lying around.

Another mechanic I was not fond of is the health system. You can execute enemies to restore armour, but for health you need to rely on these little stimpack pick-ups, which are not super common. Sometimes I found myself just letting myself die so that my teammates would revive me and I'd go back to half health lol. I'm not really sure what I would want as an alternative, but I found myself sitting at low health a lot. Maybe I just need to get good lol.

The story / campaign was decent and engaging, but I found it very short. 8-9 hours and done. Hopefully they release another campaign or something down the road. Don't get me wrong tho, there are some truly epic moments in the campaign, especially toward the end. I won't spoil anything, but if you're a 40k fan, you'll probably c*m a lil bit lol.

I am just starting to get into the Co-Op and PVP stuff now, and so far it seems fun. I am not huge on multiplayer games, but it seems like I could maybe have some good times here. The class progression and weapon progression seems cool. Love the character customization (also LOVE how they included Chaos Space Marines / Heretic Astartes for the PVP). The matchmaking hasn't been the greatest, but I am told they are addressing that.

One final gripe: I play on a 1440p Ultra-Wide monitor, and at the time of writing this review, the game does NOT support ultra-wide resolutions, so there are big black bars on either side of the screen. Kind of a bummer, but it is on their official roadmap to address in September 2024, so shouldn't be that long of a wait. Still, kind of lame to not have it at launch.

Long-story-short, if you are a fan of 40k and/or enjoyed the first Space Marine game, you'll probably enjoy this. If you aren't familiar with 40k, some of the story and fluff might go over your head or just seem silly or over-the-stop to you, but I don't know what to tell you lol. It is obvious the makers of this game are big 40k fans, and made this game for fellow fans to enjoy. The actual gameplay mechanics leave a bit to be desired, some other games probably do it better, but I still enjoyed my time and had fun, which is what's it all about at the end of the day, right? Enjoy!

Xevichr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xevichr/,"The main campaign is a good first 6-8, something like that hours spent. I liked it a lot. Story-wise and gameplay wise, towards the end though, it does start feeling a bit dull against the Tzeentchian forces.

So far I like the game, however, getting into the Operations, which is where the replayability is supposed to be coming from, I am starting to see a lot of future shortcomings for me personally.

What I would like to be improved:
1) Tzeentchian forces are boring to fight, Tyranids are a lot more fun to face. The Traitor Marines just stand still like damage sponges, shooting you, occasionally maybe teleporting 5 meters away from their previous position.
2) Tzeentchian forces in particular, the smaller daemons with shields, why the hell do I need to do a heavy to be able to get through their shield when I am like, 4 times their size? Its weird, because in the meantime, I can literally RUN THROUGH other enemy human forces. One makes me feel like a weakling, one makes me feel like a super soldier.
3) For the classes... We need big buffs. Give us better perks, more perks, good perks EARLY (not at level 21 or whatever) and also, more weapons to choose from.

I think its mad silly for me to be able to only have 1 sidearm on certain classes.
4) More executions, for in particular, Tzeentchian forces.
5) The Hammer and the knife melee weapons need some serious buffs, besides that, I feel like taking Cleave on the powersword over single target damage on the other mode/stance is always better. We need single target melee weapons to deal bigger damage against those single targets.
6) Armor should be stronger, easier to regain and should passively regenerate more quickly. I foresee a peeking simulator where I can't afford to go in at all, because I'm just going to take more damage than what I can regain, regardless of how good I am playing.

I don't just want to be negative, so here what I like so far:
1) Character customization.
2) Main campaign story.
3) The scenery.
4) Voice acting.
5) The Hive Tyrant operation and boss fight.
6) No abrupt crashes encountered.
7) No high ping or packet loss encountered.

Its just that I think this game is good enough for me right now, but has so much more potential than it currently has. It could be the best Co-Op game ever to me, if my mentioned shortcomings are just addressed.",Recommended,1946,36.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 5
Ascate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ascate/,"Verdict: If you are a Warhammer 40,000 fan this is a must-have. I don't remember the last time I had so much fun with a game.

+ Positives +
+ Steam trading cards (3 drop, 5 to make a badge)
+ Steam achievements (50 achievements, grind, campaign, PvP and PvE)
+ The scenery is stunning. I must have spent a good 2 hours just looking around when I was playing the campaign
+ One of the best campaigns I have played in recent years
+ The campaign can be played as 3 man coop
+ Ability to replay any mission from the menu
+ Data slates with some lore as collectables
+ 6 Space Marine Classes (Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy)
+ Classes feel quite different thanks to their available weapons, playstyle and ultimate abilities
+ PvP and PvE are both fun and well-cooked modes
+ Quite a lot of customisation and each armour piece can be customised individually
+ Soundtrack kicks ass
+ The community is full of Warhammer nerds and I love it

- Negatives -
- there was an early access period for higher tiers. Although it is an industry standard at this point, I quite hate it
- achievements are buggy (I had my total kill count reset twice by the game)
- for some reason the intro and outro stuttered on my PC, completely ruining the experience for me
- Quite a serious lack of multiplayer content
-- There are only 3 PvP maps
-- Only 3 PvP modes (2 are capture based, 1 is kill based)
-- The 6 PvE maps are not exactly enough for how much you need to grind
- There are quite a lot of bugs you can encounter (clipping textures, enemies going to space, etc.).
- p2p coop multiplayer is hell as always
- Basically no ability to customise Chaos space marines in PvP (besides colours)
-- also chaos is visually easy to tell apart, giving them a serious disadvantage in PvP",Recommended,1477,72.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

thelastarchive,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thelastarchive/,"The long awaited sequel doesn't disappoint. I really enjoyed my time with the campaign (for the most part) and I look forward to getting started in the PvP and PvE modes. Combat has weight, your movement has weight, the Bolters sound and feel amazing. It really feels like you're firing dumbbells at your enemies. The game looks gorgeous in that signature Warhammer art style you've probably come to expect.

I played the game on Veteran (the 2nd hardest difficulty) assuming the game had difficulty achievements (it doesn't) and I will say, it was pretty obnoxious in some places lmao. For the most part, I enjoyed the more involved gameplay and challenge, but there is one constant source of frustration for me. Ranged enemies really don't feel *that* balanced and I really feel that a lot of damage is simply unavoidable. The game encourages you to prioritise melee combat as it keeps your health and shields flowing, and it just doesn't sit right with me when you're slashing away, parrying and using the super sick quick shot mechanic, just to have half your health disappear in the blink of an eye because a small group of ranged enemies set up out of your peripheral. I don't want this to come off as a ""I picked hard and the game was hard, what gives?"" but I would recommend playing through the campaign on normal for a better experience. This could come down to a skill issue from me, but the ranged enemies consistently annoying and kinda flipped the flow of gameplay in my opinion.",Recommended,1232,13.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

the story is short and honestly not complicated seeing as it follows up on the first game, it is a pretty niche story in of itself and I found it hard to feel attached to the characters as they spend 75% of their time together bickering, the best story bits are shown within the worlds in of themselves and the interactions within the imperium of man, and seeing this was the most fascinating part of the story as a newcomer to the warhammer world.

Gameplay is awesome, it’s one of those games that brings in some not exactly new but rather very seamless and very intuitive mechanics to a third person shooter/hack and slash that just make the game very satisfying to look at and play, the parry and dodge mechanics reward the player with executions and damage bursts that make you feel like a badass, my favorite part of these fights were especially the boss fights and larger or tankier enemies like the tunneling or the cloaked tyrannids, the quick time parry/dodge mechanics make learning how to fight them a lot more fun than you think they’d be, it’s a shame there are so few boss fights in the campaign, however I chose to play the game on normal so Its likely to be different on the higher difficulties. I personally enjoy fighting the tyrannids much more than the chaos’s forces, you’d think that there would be more rubric marines that move and fight not too dissimilarly to the space marines but most of them that were placed just stand from a distance trying to pick at your health with their guns while teleporting to different locations, with the exception of the bigger guys who do charge at you but I found that they don’t appear much in the normal difficulty, the enemy humans are a joke and the rest of the tzaangor forces are just not as interesting or satisfying to kill as it is with the bugs.

If you are a Warhammer fan or even just interested in the lore then this is an absolute must. Apart from perhaps the Total War series, this is the best Warhammer game ever released. You can absolutely tell that the developers are fans of the universe. Every detail in the game is relevant, the architecture, the armour, the weapons, the absurd 40k scale, the characters, the sound and the atmosphere. There are details in here that are obscure to all but the oldest nerds and it feels incredible to see the hobby brought together in such an incredible way. The care that the Devs have shown to capture all that makes Warhammer what it is is obvious.

And for those who don't care for the lore, its a fantastic game in it's own merits. The weapons are great and varied, the enemies are fun to fight, the classes are very distinct in terms of style. The swarm system means you can fight entire hordes and really engage that power fantasy. The customisation system could do with some areas of improvement but it is more in depth than most games which is only set to improve as more chapter cosmetics are released, which is the only area of monetisation in the game.

Is it perfect? No. The Campaign is short which isn't unexpected and the story isn't the next GOT but its perfectly fine as Warhammer stories go. The Operations variety is also a little low but this is due to be added to. The PvP is fun but likewise a little barebones, don't go into this expecting the next big PvP title. On the technical side I have heard of people having issues. But I can only report on my experience, which was a single server disconnect during the campaign. I didn't encounter any glitches of bugs visual or otherwise. Performance wise, on my above average set up at ultra setttings, it wasn't incredible but it consistently stayed above 60FPS which is what mattered, at least to me personally.

The two only true area's of criticism are the difficulty and dodgy matchmaking. Sometimes the game seems to lock and you can't find a group until you restart the game. And when you do find one, they can often have someone with the same class which is frustrating as each player class has to be different. If you are set on playing that class you then have to leave and find a new one.

And with difficulty, game scales damage and enemy health poorly and the armour/temporary health means that on high difficulties, winning operations is absurdly difficult. And not 'Elden Ring fun difficult' but frustrating difficult, an issue that is exasperated by stun locks and animation locks that often see's your entire heath bar vanish with no way to get it back beyond screwing your teammates by hoarding ineffective stims.

But what is great is that these are easily fixable problems. If you are the kind of gamer that refuses to play anything less than the most perfectly optimised game, you'll have to wait. But I can honestly say this is the smoothest launch (on a major title) I have experienced in a long time and if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game or Warhammer in general, I can absolutely recommend it.",Recommended,2650,93.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

valionic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/valionic/,"[EDIT] Original review was a meme written after a few hours of playing, so this is updating it to correctly reflect how much I enjoyed the relatively short (but sweet) story. Coming from playing Spacemarine 1 all those years ago, it absolutely smashed my expectations out of the water, it was the same experience but coated with heaps of spicy gameplay and tasty visuals, seasoned to perfection.
There is nothing to hate, you can very well be a pedant and insist that that plot-armoured hulks saving mankind by chasing a bunch of bugs isn't exactly fuel for a complex narrative, but who cares, just let yourself enjoy it, you can literally rip the head off a bug twice the size of you and better yet, you can do it in campaign co-op with friends.

This has also been one of the very few times I've actually gone out of my way to use the photo mode, the game is STUNNING, and I say this entirely from the perspective of a 3D Environment Designer, so it's normally typical that I overlook the visuals to favour level design, but not this time. Oh lord, the amount of times I just stopped to watch ensuing battles in the near distance, or gawped at structures falling apart for no other reason than it looking cool.

The combat takes a little getting used to, but after getting into the rhythm of it it's super gratifying to chain attacks between targets, turning bugs into a fine mist as the bolter lets off a hefty noise every single time you fire. The mission objectives aren't greatly involved, but they are nestled in with enough entertaining story-telling and pretty environments that I just couldn't put the game down, anticipating the next gorgeous location for Titus to get into a pickle at.

If you're genuinely a stickler for good lore, I only know it at a surface level so it perfectly appeased me, it has nice links to various factions, and it of course insists on pushing the Ultramarines and Cadians because they're the fan favourites, but it doesn't go deeper than that... And that's fine! I honestly didn't need any more from a third person shooter. The experience you're getting isn't a deep RPG storyline or novel tier narrative, it's just an excuse to cut loose and shoot some bad guys and feel unstoppable while doing it!

tl;dr game is very good, darktide walked so Spacemarine 2 could run, minor issues with booting the game up initially solved by using the alternative .exe in the game files, otherwise the game runs silky smooth even on my fire hazard of a laptop, gameplay is satisfying and I get to see my beloved titus again <3",Recommended,2102,16.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

1. The graphics are perfect for the setting, not once is something to bright or too dark. The Details in every single map is just pure eye candy, to a WH40K fan there is so much to see and watch, i often spent a few minutes in each new area admiring the scenery due to just how much attention to detail was placed in it.

2. The gun play feels extremely fun in both PVE and PVP, I never really feel like i die because of any issues with the guns or balancing personally.

3. The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ phenomenal, finishing it felt incredible, plenty of extremely well voice acted dialog and the story keeps true to the lore perfectly!

4. The HORDES AND SCALE IS JUST BRILLIANT, it just doesn't get bland to get in the middle of a horde of Tyranids and guardsmen, i adore it.

5. The unlock progression system is absolutely awesome as of new games, not a single micro transaction in sight, everything is gained through playing the game and devoting yourself to your desired class, i do wish the customisation would be a bit more in-depth, however for what it is, its extremely fun and rewarding to me personally!

There are no bugs that i have encountered in the actual game itself, it is extremely polished, i only wish they can get the servers and game launch issues fixed!

I haven't had a 40k game that has immersed me into the universe and really make me feel like im in that universe as this game has.
The story is actually quite entertaining and compelling and some characters do go through some solid arcs and growth

visuals are absolutely stunning
Campaign and Operations (PVE) is the main attraction and has full cross-play so if you have console friends you can play with them
The game play in these modes is visceral and ultra satisfying with your marine moving with weight but surprisingly amount of grace ,which makes cause hes a space marine, so you end up when you play well just doing this ballet of death and incredibly cinematic fights in melee and in range
Operations has a lot of progression and enough content for now to keep you entertained for a while (though i do want more missions but that's coming with the road map)

Eternal War (PVP) is also surprisingly very fun, it sadly doesn't have cross-play however, the combat is much faster paced
and punishing than the other modes but its very tactical with more priority on positioning and line of sights rather than just straight up who has the most accurate at moving their mouse at 30 miles an hour.

Cosmetic customisation is pretty solid with you being able to dress up as any canon or custom chapter you want with a lot of colour and decal choice, The choice for different armours is more limited and restricted but its pretty decent with where it is at now.

76561197978907626,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978907626/,"Product received for free

My no spoiler review mostly based on Multiplayer so far:

There's no premium currency in this game. All in-game cosmetics are earnable and free outside of the DLC ones they're going to be releasing

Maps are symmetrical and well-balanced for PvP; there's a definite niche each class fills that never fully overlaps one another.

My first issue is the servers and disconnecting frequently, though since SM2's first maintenance a day ago, these online disconnects went from being EXTREMELY frequent, to being rare but still noticeable.

Some abilities feel that they need work on balancing, but at times it also feels like this is a player or team issue. Example:


Another example:


Let me say that the game is NOT particularly imbalanced. In the times we've had to deal with enemy Sniper cloak, we were able to adapt to their tactics, using Bulwarks to take the first shot and detect them. Vanguards though, their grapple is nearly inescapable and almost impossible to survive if they start zipping to you. Vanguards don't need to engage in melee, but a good melee Vanguard can beat a Bulwark because of guaranteed stun.

Aside from me ranting about the class, the game is surprisingly well-optimized. The gameplay is reminiscent of Space Marine 1, though you will quickly see how different it is. Current cosmetics in the game are free and entirely earnable through playing BOTH PVP (Eternal War) and PVE (Operations), in-case you prefer a more casual and fun of playing the game.

This game is amazing, hasn't changed or deviated much from SM1's achievement system, and you don't have to worry too much about game balancing issues. Story mode is great, and you unlock more Operations the further into the story mode you are. Currently there are 6, but there will be more PvE content.

Conn4r,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Conn4r/,"This game is like if you took a game from 2008 and gave it a serious face lift, in the best way possible.


Let me preface by saying this, if you are new to 40k or don't understand the lore at all; you don't need to in order to enjoy the game. The game does a fine enough job to explain what is going on, you'll only miss out on a few in-jokes and references. Also, if you're expecting a stellar or seriously in depth story than you're looking at the wrong store page; this game is peak 2008-2012 mindless fun in the same vane as Gears of War or the OG CODS.
Which is really all you need to know in terms of the game-play, it's super fun, simple and easy to understand; if all you care about is the game-play than just know it's the best part of the game.

The story is serviceable at best and if you're not a huge lore head I can see how alot of the stuff that happens late game will be lost on you, but if you have even a basic understanding this ♥♥♥♥ is some of the coolest and most outrageous ♥♥♥♥ possible in a 40k game. Honestly that's all there is too it from the campaign side, it's there to introduce the world of 40k and Space Marines and it's a fun mindless romp you can play through at your own speed.

The online operations is where the game truly shines, the customization level of your own Space Marine is insane, you have a huge array of different perks, weapons, equipment and classes that you can play with to your hearts content. The cosmetic customization of your Space Marine is insane, you can color basically any part of your armor in whatever color you want(as long as you unlock the color first however), if you wanna make your Space Marine a hodge podge of every color in the rainbow you can and then some; and if you're a lore head there's a good chance your super obscure Successor Chapter nobody knows or plays besides you is in the game as well.

The level of detail this game has makes it very clear that this was made by fans of Warhammer 40,000 for fans of Warhammer 40,000, every little detail you'd think they'd overlook, they didn't.

If you're a fan of 40k you've probably already bought the game, but if not than know that this game is 100% faithful and shows the proper respect to the IP you'd hope for.

(Unless you're a Firstborn purist than get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ig lol, Primaris for life.)

(Also if the negative reviews seem weird it's cause they are, most of them are people who either over value wide screen support and think it makes or breaks an entire video game, have a moldy potato they call a PC and are upset it can't run the game(just upgrade already dude) or are just rage baiting.))",Recommended,2136,61.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 7
deathwingtheboss,https://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwingtheboss/,"The game has that 40k feel for sure, it feels amazing to decimate those filthy xenos with full gore.

Pros:

- The story is intriguing, I did keep wondering what's going on.
- The visuals are simply amazing. The depth and size of everything is very obvious.

Cons:

- No sense of progress, I wouldn't put this in cons if it didn't exist in the first place. But there's an armoury unlock system that doesn't really differ from one another. Most items are pretty much the same and pretty underwhelming.
- The friendly AI is pretty much non-existent. They're good at following you and following only. They can't really do anything else. In higher difficulties, they'll go off on their own and do nothing while a massive xeno army will tear you apart.


Nevertheless, these are fixable through patches, so I'd like to leave a good review. Maybe not full price, but definitely worth it if you have finished the first game of the series.",Recommended,774,5.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Single player and story part is amazing! Vibe, story, missions, design, overall feeling is great! You will not regret it, it's distilled 40k experience. You can see devs love and know what they are doing.

However multiplayer part is a mixed bag. It's not bad, but not good either. It feels forced, poorly balanced and atrociously repetitive chore. Also, in multiplayer clunky controls (tried both twin stick and mouse/keyboard) and game UI is bigger challenge then your enemies. (Hope it will be fixed).

BlackVanCrow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackVanCrow/,"Product received for free

Ah, Space Marine 2, a game worthy of the the Primarch’s embrace. The first taste of its brutality hits like a bolt of lightning in the dark—swift, merciless, and glorious. As one who revels in the screams of the weak, I must say this offering does not disappoint. The visceral beauty of cleaving through the enemy, the symphony of destruction wrought by the Adeptus Astartes is intoxicating.

The graphics—sharp as a freshly honed blade—make every kill a work of art, every spray of blood a brushstroke on a canvas of chaos. The attention to detail is exquisite; from the crackle of power armor to the haunting shadows that cling to every corner of the battlefield, it immerses you in the darkness, the brutality, and even at times, in the fear. Ah, yes, the fear. One can almost taste it.

The combat? A delightful storm of rage and precision. Every strike feels as if you hold death itself in your hands. They’ve captured the sensation perfectly—brutal, unrelenting, and oh, so satisfying. You are a weapon, an instrument of war. And how sweet it is to unleash that power upon the hordes, to crush them beneath your heel like the scum they are. Whether tearing through xenos filth or obliterating the pathetic wretches known as the Thousand Sons, each battle is an opportunity to revel in their demise.

In short, if you crave destruction, if you hunger for the thrill of battle, this is your feast. Space Marine 2 is a masterpiece of carnage, a hymn to the carnage that resides in us all. The Imperium's 'finest' are here to deliver death—swift, brutal, and without mercy.

I'd closely compare it to LOTR: Shadow of Mordor, there's a lot of different combos and buttons for different things, which is somewhat overwhelming. Other than that, it's graphically beautiful, there are no framerate issues, the story is good and the combat is good.

My CPU is quite hot and the fans are pumping a lot of air, but I also have other things running. I could see this being an issue for certain people or lower end builds but it's not as bad as some other games I've played, such as Zombie Army, and the settings can always be lowered if necessary.

I played through the campaign in around 8.5 hours. It's not all that long, but I don't mind that. What I do mind is that I was quite bored by the end of it. The combat system feels good at first, but never develops or progresses, so it ends up quite shallow. Enemy variety is pitiful, making combat even more repetitive. Guns feel weedy. This may be to push players into more melee combat, but it still feels out of keeping with the setting.

The story moves along at a decent clip. There are some decent set-pieces and the character beats, while somewhat repeated from the first game, basically work. It's not the most sophisticated take on the WH40K universe. It's basically ""OOH RAH SPACE MARINES"", which would be disappointing at the best of times, but feels a bit sinister with a Russian developer. Your regularly scheduled reminder - the Imperium are not the good guys.

Visually, it does the minimum necessary. There visual design has a few good moments, but it's weird for a major 2024 release to have no ray tracing and be 100% rasterisation. The lighting looks flat and artificial throughout.

I didn't dislike the game, but it's nothing special. It's a short, shallow corridor shooter with some decent WH40K trappings. I've given it the thumbs up because it is very slightly more good than bad, but overall... wait for a sale.",Recommended,1169,8.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
flyingscotsmn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingscotsmn/,"Blood for the blo... Praise the Emperor! Will recommend for how well it's made:

Armor: good customization but not every chapter is represented since it's based on Ultra marines. Not a big deal but I can get close enough for Death Specres. I'm a chaos fan but there are no options for chaos armors which is disappointing for PvP and PvE operations so more customization would be very appreciated.

Main story: (Have not finished) Good and decent length missions if you're not speed running or running for the next checkpoint to survive a wave since you ran out of bolter ammo.

PvP: I've played about 4-5 matches. Not sure if you choose astartes or chaos and it always defaults to those since every match I ended up being chaos. Assault may need a small rework? I tended to get dumpstered or not dashing towards players and resulting in geting 20 bolter rounds to the face while my hammer smashes air.

Operations: Only 6 missions so I hope this increases to add some more variety. Sadly no chaos armors. Good customization for a lot of the chapters like I mentioned and I hope they add more. I've had to put some spin on pre Heresy World Eaters and Death Specres. Decently fun and gives incentive for harder missions that pay out more. Tried a mission on Normal mode with a friend and a bot: Bot was worse than useless. Boss spawned in and the bot didn't fire a single shot as an assault. *If you're playing above easy make sure you have a full squad* It was a flying boss so he just stood around looking at it like he was about to draw it like one of his French Sororitas.",Recommended,1289,26.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 8
DKHarper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DKHarper/,"EDIT: After putting more time in and the game has had it's global release, I've encountered less of my original issues.

There are still thee occasional minor issue. Mostly around cosmetics and the frame drops, but seems a lot more playable than before.

And I'm unsure whether they have changed the difficulty, but whilst I have admittedly 'gotten better' and learnt how to get around the game and it's mechanics. I still feel that if someone came in that didn't play many games jumped into 'Easy' they would really struggle.

-----

PREVIOUS NEGATIVE REVIEW BELOW:

Unfortunately, as much as I love the game and the universe I cannot recommend this in this state. And feel like Early Access from preordering is another word for free QA.

The game idea is great, and the multiplayer is great...when they both work.

At the time of writing this I have messed about with a few of the lower end difficulties, and even then I'm finding completing certain tasks impossible.

A single player mission is insane to complete when it seems to be built with co-op in mind. And with the operations, with other players the difficulty curve on Easy difficulty is strange. I feel the focus on gaining armour and such from combat doesn't always seem to work. Or you get stun locked when you fail one of the parries, losing most armour and health without coming out of the stun. Again, this was on the easiest difficulty. Some enemies are a pain to fight, either attacks that are poorly telegraphed or attacks that you seemingly have no defence or hope to avoid.

And then there's the technical aspect, which is mostly bugs. I've had cosmetic issues, with certain customisation constantly failing on multiplayer. And texture pop-in, with the latter being understandable. But then there are game breaking bugs that have caused me to have to stop progress and restart the game. Or have to alt + F4.

The main two that come to mind are:

Audio bugs, where the sound will either not play certain aspects or cut out altogether and requires a full restart of the game.

Multiplayer loading, getting stuck on the Joining Server screen infinitely and having to kill the game process. The fact that it has to Join Server just to get to the main menu if you want to play single player can really affect this last bug.

So again, unfortunately whilst it seems like a great game, with the strange gameplay decisions and the bugs that often ruining experience, I cannot recommend.",Recommended,2039,29.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Kanturu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanturu/,"I write this review after completing the campaign, I have not played the co-op mode or the multiplayer yet.

If you are a warhammer 40k fan, let alone a space marines enjoyer, I think you absolutely must play this game. It is simply the *best* space marines experience a video game has provided to date. It is VERY intense and brutal just as it should be, and I would prefer you go and discover the rest for yourself instead of hinting at anything else.

I will mention that the game is not perfect, and there are improvements that I hope are made down the line to make it an even better experience.
You play the game with 2 bots (who can be played by your friends instead). The bots are good with dispatching enemies, but can not play some objectives, making it quite a struggle some times.
The non-swarm enemies require some tuning I believe to how much health they have, and ranged enemies accuracy is way too good. These are all fixable issues that I have noticed other players also mentioning, so I hope by the time you read this they have already been addressed.


On the technical side, I had no glaring issues at all. I played the entire game without any game breaking glitches/bugs and very rarely I had frame drops (and those lasted a brief moment at most). The game is BEAUTIFUL.

The Techpriests have been hard at work retrieving ancient gaming schematics from up to a decade past to reconstruct a game to sink your chainsword into. Truly a gem built on the ruins and relics of better times. Long may this continue the Emperor DEMANDS it.

There is still much heresy to be purged, but in this game know this brother; Every last Space Marine has a ""gentleman's Boltgun"". I can't believe I have to state that however in this time of such fervent and rife heretical scheming it's worth knowing what you can trust.

I have it on good authority that the Custodes have already been breached with the taint of traitor filth. Holy Terra will be up to its neck in was/were's if they don't staunch the flow of this foulest of ichors.

76561197994855401,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994855401/,"As 40k and Tyranid fan this game was a must buy for me. I am a bit sad that the Single Player campaign is only about 10 hours long. Probably shorter, as i was taking the scenic route, gawking at scenery and whatnot.

The game looks the part, but I am not sure I agree with it feeling the part. The Bots you play with are terrible. They are sluggish to perform orders like “Engage/Defend (Area)” or simple Targeted Commands that they should focus on a special. Even when they move to the place, they tend to forget their order at the first opportunity.

This has made some of the missions very difficult to deal with. When I started the game I started it in Veteran Difficulty, because the game said this was the intended difficulty. Which is information I like, when they tell you which gamemode it is balanced around.

And while i had no real trouble, i mean i died once or twice in the Tutorial, but that was fine… when i got to the end event of the first mission where i had to defend 4 objectives, while dealing with a bunch of horde and specials… I ran into the problem that the Bots were useless. Having to do everything myself. Even when I gave them orders to Defend the objectives, they would only go to defend the objective when no enemy was nearby. And so i kept failing the mission over and over again… even when i could defend the objectives, it was the specials that killed me, as i had to eschew my own survival in order to clear the objectives in time… and all because my Bot-Mates would rather pummel a Gant than shoot at one of the Specials or engage them in any meaningful way, despite me ordering them to do so, by marking the enemy.

So I had to drop down to “Normal”... Normal on the other hand is way too easy. Even though you have to do everything yourself. I feel like Veteran is probably the difficulty to play with a Co-Op buddy.

The Story wasn’t good. It wasn’t really bad either, but it definitely wasn’t good. The Dev knew I wouldn't care, and thus didn’t put any effort in. I mean, I would have cared if they had cared, but they really didn’t.

I haven’t played the Co-Op content, so I am not sure what the Operations are like, but the PvP is fun. Seems more stable than it was in the first game. But of course, you are locked out of higher level gear until you played a lot and it makes a lot of difference. I’ve ran into people that threw their Thunderhammers around with their Jump Packs… and I expect the old Meltagun Meta to make a return as well.

There also seem to be only 3 PvP maps. Admittedly i was jumping around at first, but after a little over 2 hours of PvP games, i only seens 3 maps. Gamemodes are okay.. The abilities don’t feel overpowered, just deadly in the right circumstances. Locking gear behind player levels is a bad idea tho.

Overall i am giving this a 7 out of 10 on the arbitrary review scale and recommend it being picked up on a sale. If you have friends to play Co-Op with or want some PvP content, that isn’t as good as Eternal Crusade was, then paying full price is fine, but for a single player experience, wait for a sale.",Recommended,2511,55.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Space Marine 2 is a breath of fresh air and shows the gaming industry that you CAN make a solid product if you just simply stick to the lore, know your target audience and deliver a product that is finished, polished and working ON RELEASE! Do these basic things and you get a very successful game and make bank

Gameplay is outstanding, and it is HARD! I play on veteran difficulty and waw, the developers didnt hold back. Your constantly on edge as you face swarms of Xenos aiming to bring you down and they do not hold back for a second. You really feel like a space marine as you get stuck into the enemy alongside your battle brothers. Just from the intro, i was gritting my teeth as i fought for Mankind against the unrelenting swarm of Tyranids

The sound in this game would blow you away, this game oozes with immersion.
The graphics look unreal, everything is well polished, every inch has not been wasted to show the carnage of outright war. At all times you feel or see there is always something happening in the background like the Astra Militarum fighting off the Tyranids.

The customisation of your own space marine is like no other. Truly worthy of a product. The attention to detail is amazing, tons of different chapters to choose from INCLUDING splinter chapters or successor Legions. Or you can make your own personal Chapter.

Definitely worth the asking price, for once, a AAA game that actually deserves the price it is asking. This is a proper, full fledged, top to bottom quality product, a must have for any fans of the Warhammer40k Universe

Games Workshop. I hope your paying attention to this game. If you go woke with 40k and start messing with the lore like Amazon is already trying to do with the live action tv show, then you will lose money.
This game stuck to the lore and only the lore, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, modern politics, no Gaslighting fans, no woke BS.

10/10

76561198107331418,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107331418/,"I can absolutely say this game lives up to being a phenomenal sequel to the original Space Marine game. Even as I am writing this I am continuing my campaign against the Tyranid threat. Saber Interactive have truly put together something to be proud of, you can tell with the world building and the discrete details in the environmental storytelling that you are not in this fight alone. It truly feels like the Imperium of Man is attempting to hold the line. Walking past the brutalised and dismembered corpses of your fellow brothers and guardsmen alike as hordes of Tyranids breach defensive lines and push further into friendly territory gets you exhilarated as you partake in such a desperate struggle to defend the planets. If you are like me you will rush to the aid of the guardsmen serving with you in a hopeless, but nevertheless needed, rescue attempt.

I truly believe that if you were considering this game, give it a shot. This will be one to remember.

I do see a lot of individuals are reporting crashes and optimisations issues or EOS issues which are understandable. However, EOS is for the cross platform play and the individuals experiencing some issues with the EULA please look up pirate software, he gives a great explanation on the subject. Unfortunately if you read the EULA of all of the your favourite multiplayer games, they will be very similar.

The EOS issue is the only real problem and unfortunately as time goes on some older computer parts may no longer be up to snuff to play the game on High or ultra quality. So before complaining about optimisation don't forget to configure your own system to play smoothly. However give the game time. As it stands I believe this is still one of the smoothest launches of 2024.

The only downside I have found to this game is the AI controlled space marines that run as your squad mates. They unfortunately do not always perform the best, however I understand these are also here to allow your friends to join you in Coop which in itself is truly amazing.

Overall the 40k world is a brutal mistress and playing this feels true to its lore. This is not a story of sunshine and rainbows but one of death, fire and brimstone. The Emperor protects.",Recommended,1833,17.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

Yelsoh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yelsoh/,"As someone who has been eagerly waiting years for a proper Warhammer 40K game with space marines. When I learned that they were going to make a sequel to Space Marine, I was a bit worried as much as I was excited.

Space Marine 1 had many faults and a sequel released in 2024 would have much to live up to.

And I can happily say that WH40K: Space Marine 2, not only met but exceeded every expectation I had.

A lot of people are mad about the clunky gameplay, and while that is a complaint. Its not so bad that it ruins the gameplay. It is also worth noting that you are a 8 foot tall man in a suit of insanely heavy armor, moving is hard, I MEAN DO YOU SEE THOSE KNEE JOINTS? THERE CLIPPING MOST OF THE TIME! Anyway as someone who has hard times enjoying single player games, I genuinely enjoyed this game and played through the 12-16 hour campaign in one day.

Which is a good seg-way to reviewing the story! The story was clearly made with a lot of love and care behind it, making references from space marine 1 while being completely original in its own right. For the general audience of gaming it may seem like a bland story, very linear. And easily forgettable, but to us Warhammer 40K fans this is a masterpiece. The mentions of the last game, the Tyronids, the Chaos marines, fighting with a dread-knought even just for a little. This is exactly what we have wanted for years, a full realization of space marines in a video game that has multiplayer and you can play with friends in both campaign and in matches.

Lets talk about multiplayer now. Its okay... The clunky slow responsive mechanics are okay in the campaign but in the multiplayer, the issues with it really come out. I cannot exactly describe the issue, its more something I recommend you experience for yourself. Other then that the lag and rubber-banding is good enough, it is playable and even fun, but sadly if you are new and near the point of initial release you may encounter a level 13 in your level 1 game.

The graphics... The graphics are amazing, nothing more needs to be said here. Some levels need more optimization then others, especially in the later half, however I will survive with 30 fps.

Weapon balancing... During the campaign the weapon balance is pretty good, Personally I would make changes like increasing range and damage on flamer and melta, a faster firing speed for the plasma rifle and more ammo overall, especially for the lascannon. But that is it, most if not all weapons are decently fairly balanced and I cannot complain too much.

A lot of game studios think open world or bigger is better ideals for games are better, and its also true the audience has gotten tired of linear shooters over the years. But I am happy this is a small linear hack and slash shooter. This game and the DOOM games are proof that Linear games simply haven't lost their edges. They are still needed and still relevant, its just greedy companies taking the passion out of the developers that's really killing these kinds of games.

Either way, I give this game a 9/10 and I really hope they make updates and events or even add DLC that add more story. Cause before this game I was not invested in Titus... But now I am, and I kinda need more of the brother.

Anyway hopefully you found this helpful!",Recommended,2697,16.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

[Text] Pity The Guardsmen
I saw a request for this and figured i would type it up. I think this has been posted before(couldn't find it). Also first post so formatting may need some fixing.



Pity the guardsmen



A weak sack of flesh destined to die for a dead god that never cared, it spends its pitiful, brief life, alone in his foxhole with nothing to keep him company, or to keep him safe, than the cheapest, most disposable of equipment. Perhaps the glow from his lasgun barrel keeps him warm at night.



Me? As a servant of the powers I enjoy the delights of all this world and the warp has to offer. Power, it courses through my veins. The gifts of the chaos gods will soon overtake me, and one day I may even ascend. What has the guardsman to look forward to but a grim life, and if he is lucky perhaps he will feel nothing as my axe sends his soul to Khorne.



He lives for a corpse god, and he shall join his god, as a corpse. I shall spare a half second to think of him and his kind. Then i shall only laugh. Hail Chaos!

You would laugh monster, But let me remind you.

Within that weak sack of meat and bone, uncared for by his god and wept for by none, beats a heart. A human heart, that carries with it the strength and courage of all mankind. Within that sack of meat is ensconced the hope, the will, and the fury of every man woman and child from every corner of the Imperium. Within that weak sack of meat, festooned in thin armour and weapons only powerful in numbers, beats the heart of a man. And for ten thousand years, the hearts of men have beaten, strongly, in defiance of your so called ""powers"". For ten thousand years, the hearts of men have stood united against a galaxy that despises them for no reason save that they had the audacity not to lay down and die. For then thousand years, your black crusades have been pushed back, beaten down and made a mockery of, by weak sacks of flesh with cheap weapons and disposable equipment.



For that weak sack of flesh that you so gleefully mock is no super soldier, no immortal warrior, no creature cursed by chaos like you. He is a man, an imperial guardsmen drawn from some forgotten corner of the Imperium to fight for his species and for the safety of the people he loves. He is a factory worker, a farmer, a storekeeper, a father, a brother, a son, a mere man. And against creatures like you, teeming and numberless, powered by the very will of thirsting gods......... He holds the line. He has held the line for ten thousand Years.

I-Am-Really-Not-Human,https://steamcommunity.com/id/I-Am-Really-Not-Human/,"Yea, the whole EPIC services is annoying and all and I do agree with other people who reviewed the game negatively about it. But I am reviewing this game purely for gameplay and it's content.

This game is amazing cinematic experience, and I am constantly switching to Photomode just to capture the amazing atmosphere and battles. Even playing the game it self is pure atmospheric overload (especially the mission where you are not on the starting planet). Though the missions are linear and on the rails, both co-op and single-player, but it was designed that way. It's still a bit to early to give concrete review of the whole game, it did just release in Advanced Access, not even full release, and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game. But from what I see at the moment, if you don't care about the EPIC games EULA crap and just want to have gore spilling, gut splattering action with absolute tanks, pure killing machines of soldiers, give it a try, you can always refund the game in the first three hours of gameplay if you don't like it.

As for the performance problems some people are experiencing, it depends on the system I suppose. I do get some dips at moments, even at most random parts, but I had them only a few times in the first six hours of play time.

My observations are based on me going in completely blind, having seen almost no promotional material. Also, I'm playing on Arch Linux through Proton, and have had no issues aside from the Steam Overlay causing crashes on launch. Disabling the overlay fixed the crashes and I've had no issues since.

Pros:
- Combat feels great, punchy almost in the same way Doom 2016 does.
- Veteran difficulty is actually hard, which was unexpected.
- Customisation is deep and varied, but not too complex.
- Helmet option for the campaign
- You feel big and heavy
- Framerate is sitting around 70-80fps, with very little deviation between intense scenes and simple ones.

As with basically everything, its not perfect, but this may very well be the last great relic of gaming as franchises everywhere else fall to the woke virus or corporate greed and cutting corners. Everything said, I could sing the praises of this game for pages and pages and pages. If you aren't a wokehammer fan, play this game. Otherwise, go to any of the other franchises you've flopped already. ""Brothers, we hold this ground in the name of the Primarch... If we fall, we fall with Vengence on our lips"".- Titus.
Now, the reason I write this review, other than to give the game a WELL deserved good review. To cover the shortcomings of the game. First, gunstrikes should make you invincible like executions do. I hate being low on armor, seeking them out and ending up loosing all my armor from the little adds hitting me. Second, stagger. The fact that I, as a space marine, aren't able to stun lock a majoris or minoris, wtf. I'm a genetically altered super soldier in super soldier armor with super weapons. I get some of the nids are impressive, but come on. I shouldn't have to, with leveled equipment, be worried about a 1 on 1 with these guys. Furthermore, some of these majoris enemies will end up going into what I call a rage. They basically get to a weird state where they basically can't be staggered by normal means and they just perpetually spam melee attacks. Third, tune up the ai. Ai players are hot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can't figure anything out. The only reason they are MARGIONALLY better than not having anyone there is the fact that they have infinite ammo, and can regen hp out of combat. But even then, sometimes they don't rez, they don't shoot, they don't attack. I've seen some essentially be afk players for long stretches. The ranged majoris ai needs work too. They tend to just spam running/tping away while spamming shots and wire bombs at you. (Side note, the wire bombs need a cooldown so the whole room can't get covered in them). Fourth, yes, there are game bugs. The infinite loading one, game crashes and other stuff needs work. I trust/ hope that will be addressed in the future.
Now, all these issues aren't an exhaustive list. I'll probably add to it if any major ones come up in the future, but again, I can't stress enough the stamp of approval I give to this game. I will continue it on unless they make a wokehammer or helldiver esk mistake. Hopefully this game lives up to the greatness it can be.",Recommended,2039,50.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

76561198012108903,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012108903/,"It's an amazing game. Definitely recommend it, BUT:
HOLY SMOKES the AI is so UTTERLY worthless and plain ♥♥♥♥, the devs would have been better off reducing enemy army size ba a third for every slot not filled with a player.

Let me be clear devs: Your AI is so worthless, I'd rather not play the campaign on high difficulty without my friends online. Co-op is similar, the AI is so utterly ♥♥♥♥ and useless, playing anything above easy with 2 players and one AI companion is like playing with 1.5 players, because one has to make up for the complete lack of everything the AI is SUPPOSED to provide. It is an insult to the word ""Bot"".

Everything else is pretty friggin great, though. The guns all have their uses, despite my personal absolute disdain for the the basic Bolt Pistol. They all sound heavy, they all sound like the pack some serious firepower. Melee sounds heavy and appropriately metal-y, too. A lot of the stuff you would expect from Warhammer 40k is in here, lots of heretics, lots of blind fanaticism and faith, an unhealthy amount of reliance on the machine spirit, Marines and Mechanicus not exactly being the fondest of one another in most careses. Oh, and evne more heretics and herecy to stamp out. Great for someone that has absolutely no idea about the lore, and probably even better for someone who actually knows parts of the lore!

Visuals are equally great. The detail may be a bit offover long distances, and the game definitely excells when you're in the thick of the melee, but in general, it holds up REALLY well, and it runs amazing, too! No DLSS requires to make up for the lack of optimization or the publisher rushing things through. DLSS still helps, mind you, but it definitely runs really well!

Now, the controls. ooof, the controls. The basic keybindings may make sense on a console, but whoever set the standard keybindings for PC either simply DOESN'T play on a PC, or has a third arm and hand. I had to rebind about 50% of the basic keybinds for them to even make sense, and even THEN I wish I could set bindings per class (in multiplayer) and game mode. Also, the game has non-optional input queueing. An option only absolute idiots put in their game.

I don't walkt to talk much about the story, since spoiler and all that, but the story actually explains why the co-op exists, and that's neat!

Overall, around a 7/10. It would have been an 8/10 if the AI wasn't hot garbage. I'd rather face 2/3 less enemies in the campaign and not have these two bozos tagging along. And I'd rather, in multiplayer, fight less enemies than have the worthless AI take over a slot for someone who disconnected or left.

Campaign is surprisingly short, with a story that is as predictable as you'd expect. Its a space marine story don't get your high hopes. No modern overly woke dei ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, as far as I can tell. The character stay focused on being soldiers in a war. Which is a relief. Just clean fun. Only six operations which is not that many on launch. Combine with limited content in multiplayer. Acts as early access looking at the road map. Which should now get plenty of support looking at player numbers, as of time of writing.

Plenty of fun to be had. Not the 'legendary game' some people give the perception of. Its fun with a good amount of flaws. Such as optimization, while impressive given the graphical fidelity. You can tell the year delay was badly needed to get it to this state. Much more to be done there.

76561198011694358,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011694358/,"Fundamentally enjoyable and fun, the game is currently held back by several glaring issues.

-Crashes during cutscenes, or loading screens
-Low frames, and large frame drops during even non combat sections
-Lack of ultrawide support
-Lack of shared campaign progress for multiplayer co-op campaigns. Only the host progresses.

All of these (possibly barring campaign progress) are fixes that we have been told are coming. One other problem I find is the wonky controls. Left click shoot, right click melee, mmb aim as a default is perhaps understandable, but horrible to use in practice.

I've experimented with several other alternatives to move these actions around and simply can't get comfortable with any. It's my belief that this would be best fixed by separating controls based on currently held weapon. If I'm holding a bolter and hit the melee button, I don't need it to pull out my sword and pistol in a scuffed form where It hotswaps to the bolter to fire instead if I then attempt to shoot. I'd have been fine being punished with a weak melee attack instead of having this overly permissive but utterly unintuitive control scheme.",Recommended,959,36.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

criss9000,https://steamcommunity.com/id/criss9000/,"I give this game a 7/10 for a few specific reasons.

But first, a disclaimer:
I wrote this review after approximately 20 hours of playing this game. I wrote it specifically from a beginner's perspective.
At the time of writing this review, I have played the campaign on level 2 difficulty and am currently playing the co-op PVE mode.
I've yet to touch the PVP modes.
This is based on my experience from before the patch on the 11th of September.
Also there's negligible wokeness in this game, and it's ignoreable.

-1 point because no game is ever perfect.

-0.5 points because there is potential for them to do more that is not realized and it's a damned shame.

-0.5 point because of a multitude of minor design oversights that on their own aren't meaningful but they all stack up to create a bit of a problem.
I will elaborate further below.

-0.5 points because of technical issues on release which could have been resolved if they just had more public tests and took a bit more time to iron these kinks out.
I've experienced a couple of unexplainable disconnection errors over the course of the first few hours of playing the online co-op mode as well as one CTD.
That being said, these incidents of technical issues have been relatively far and few between.
But the technical state on release is overall very acceptable.

-0.5 points for some of the story tropes - some of them seem bizarre and there's one that does not fit in the lore of Warhammer 40,000.
One character in the campaign behaves in a way that is far from typical for the culture of his military unit.
Also there's this one girlboss character that I was glad is not present for most of the campaign. She should've been made as a male character instead, judging by her rather masculine appearance and behavior.
Lieutenant Mira from the first Space Marine game was spot on though, I really liked her.
Compared to Mira, this character who is her equivalent in Space Marine 2 is simply boring.

As for the gameplay design oversights:
It's an amalgamation of very minor things such as maneuvers, animations, delays and various nuances of gameplay that both players and enemy NPCs have, as well as weapon balance and its own subtle nuances.

Simply put, the balance of combat feels very frustrating for a beginner. It goes beyond needing some getting-used-to and player skill.

The enemies' set of combat maneuvers applies extreme pressure on individual players.
Player teams that split their attention - which happens far more often than not in horde shooters like Space Marine 2 - can find themselves vastly overwhelmed, and this can cost rookie players the mission in a way that feels a bit more than frustrating.

It feels like the current state of Helldivers 2 (before the balance overhaul on the 17th of September), to be quite honest. I just feel like the game hates me for whatever reason that it won't reveal.

Tyranid enemies with ranged weapons have the ability to knock a player over and interrupt those players in the middle of fighting a horde at melee range.

On top of that, Tyranid warriors (the medium-size enemies) often knock over players with their sword strikes, contributing further to the inability for players to do anything for several seconds at a time.

This combination means that enemy units that have ranged weapons are far more than just an annoyance: their knocking effect can result in a stunlock.

And remember that this is a horde shooter, you're not dealing with just 1 or 2 of each type. Oftentimes there are 4 or 5 of each of them that you have to deal with while your teammates are off fighting another swarm that's just the same or worse.

TL;DR = THE STUN LOCK IS REAL, EVADE EVADE EVADE EVADE EVADE

All of this is aside from the sluggish and slow reactions of the soldiers that players control which give this game a feeling of mild slowness.
Striking enemies with melee weapons feels somewhat underwhelming as well, as it takes more than one strike with the medium-sized melee weapon types like the sword-chainsaw against the small fodder enemies (which, if you ask me, really should be beat by a single swing - the small fodder enemies in Space Marine 1 were beat in one swing, so why not in SM2?).
(notice I said types.)

And the last point I want to make is the unlocking of cosmetic items.
WHY DO I NEED TO UNLOCK STUFF I DON'T WANT JUST FOR THAT ONE COLOR THAT I DO WANT?
I only want one color, I DO NOT want the entire pack of emblems and colors. Let me unlock only the one color I want. (for example: Golden Griffon in the Night Lords unlocks under the Heretic legions tab)

These are the negatives I found so far in 24 hours of playing, and I don't believe there's much else in the negative side of the game.

Overall the game is very good.

The campaign has many epic and cool moments that real men with more than a drop of testosterone will enjoy a lot.

Classes feel like meaningful choices that have more to do with your preferred playstyle rather than being better or worse than others.

Despite the necessity for more tuning, the combat balance does feel like a lot of thought and fine-tuning went into it. It's just ALMOST where it should be, in my opinion.

And as stated above, technical issues have been few and far between, so this game is on the better side of matters of technical stability.
My 6-years-old, poorly-maintained PC with i7-8700, 16 GiB RAM and RTX 2070 produces around 20 FPS in the busiest sections. It is holding, but only just. (Maybe I should request that my Magos perform the rites of restoration to appease the machine spirit, then it may produce higher framerates)

This game is good fun and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good souls-lite 3rd person horde shooter.",Recommended,4753,87.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

76561198024692002,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024692002/,"The Good:
The combat has a lot more depth than the hack and slash of the first game. It can be as simple or complicated as you want with the parries, gunstrike, armor juggling and perfect dodging alongside class interactions. Sound design and voice acting are top notch.
Slaying enemies is satisfying and the game loop is relatively fun. It has a sort of gears of war 2/3 or halo 2/3 era vibe but with enhanced graphics and QOL.

The Bad:
The main downside I’ve had are stability issues with long term gaming, I have to restart every few hours so there may be some optimization issues. The locked 1 class per team in pve is a bummer but I get why it’s limited.",Recommended,541,41.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

The core gameplay is amazing, the best part of the game by far. It is easy to learn and get the basics of but hard to master, learning perfect dodge and parry times is very rewarding. The core progression feels great, cosmetics, weapon upgrades, and perks. The optimisation is very well done, I have a decent PC and I'm running a constant 60 (or higher) on medium settings which still looks great. The campaign and Co-Op operations are amazing, good for new people to the franchise and great for long time fans.

HunterCat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HunterCat/,"A Great solid game, a masterpiece even.
Gameplay is fun, gunplay is fun, the melee system takes a bit of time to adjust.
The story, oh god the story is epic, just what I was expecting from the game. Lilttle callbacks to the SpaceMarine 1 story are nice. Additional dialogs are great for immersion.
And the finale is quite excellent.
People saying campaign is short, I dunno, if you dont rush through it the lenght is, well, lengthy. Peaks and wraps up just at the right moment. If you are unsatisfied there is coop missions, that go along side the campaign timeline.

Now the bad part, game has some techincal flaws(for now). Those that I noticed are:
Connection sometimes doesnt connect, working weird in general. Disabling crossplay helps.
DLSS is buggy. Game runs smooth, 60fps(a standart for me) and all, but If you are unfortunate bastard, like me, that has 2GB of VRAM despite having 3050 (which is mobile, laptop gaming whoo) you will experince wierd stuff with textures. No matter the settings they will be blurry, sometimes characters and objects become invisable. Switching to TAA helps a lot but it doesnt solve it 100%. There is also some work around with Nvidia control pannel, something about CUDA reserve and you just need to activate it.
But maybe its just a me thing, still worth mentioning IMO. The game does requite a good rig to run it, but I cant say my rig is weak or something. Or maybe it is but eeeeeeeeh.
Ah yes, something something, no ultrawide support(yet, just wait till end of September). Something something, no FOV slider and all that.
Real Ultramarines dont need that tech-heresy to play a great game. Haha, but seriously it isnt that critical, or atleast for me it wasnt.
EOS on other hand...... I'll let that slide this time, but Inquisition WILL know about it.

Pros:
Incredible graphics and scenery
Story, characters and 40k IP done well
Classes, weapons, customisation and builds
Gunplay is great, melee combat is decent (not perfect, lots of rolling)
Interesting missions and bosses in both Campaign and Operations PvE

Cons:
Campaign and Operations don't join together at all. In Campaign you can't choose your class which is annoying, particularly in co-op, and then when you get to Operations, you can't play your campaign build as it doesn't exist?
The menus and UI is shockingly bad on PC, at some points it even shows press ""RB and LB"" and you have to guess what that is on PC.
The progression system is convoluted and very poorly designed, there are many ""tokens"" and different progression systems), some operations (avoiding spoilers) are just not worth ever playing from a progression stand-point. Class and Weapon balance doesn't work well, part of this is due to the fact that the melee combat is decent but just doesn't really work at high enemy density - you're just rolling and fishing for parries/gun shots, slow weapons just get you killed.",Recommended,944,43.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

This is especially true for its multiplayer mode where the underlying mechanics are quite simple but fun. It oddly reminds me of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy's multiplayer mode.

The campaign is relatively short but decent; the operations mode seems like a cool idea to extend the campaign experience by putting the player in the shoes of Titus' subordinates who operate in parallel with Titus' own squad. Perhaps oddly, I have found the multiplayer mode to be the most engaging one out of these three even though it seems more like an afterthought in comparison. I hope that they expand upon the existing content with new maps and new modes, perhaps containing AI swarms that are hostile to both teams, like in the campaign.

While it is generally good that it feels like an oldschool game, the game also inherits the pitfalls and annoyances of oldschool games such as unnecessarily many and long loading screens and lack of various quality-of-life features.

Overall, it is a very solid game worth trying out for fans of oldschool games. Their published roadmap seems somewhat shallow; I hope add even more content in the future. Additionally, I also hope to see DLSS 3 Frame Generation implemented as soon as possible given how severely CPU-intensive the game is. Of course, proper engine optimizations would be preferable but I'll take frame generation over nothing. Lastly, I'd also like to see them implement NIS sharpening to combat blur introduced by DLSS/DLAA.",Recommended,1298,59.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 12

now that I've gotten that out of the way - I can say that I recommend the game itself, but the game is short and my gripes are some very serious ones.

firstly - the disclosure on the steam store page that this game requires a 3rd party EULA agreement is disgustingly understated, it is entirely possible to not see that this game requires it (considering you have to scroll down) and anybody will just casually assume the EULA agreement is for saber's governing of online play - instead you buy a steam game to.. install Easy Anticheat then to launch epic games completely undisclosed.. to launch the game.. to get told to make a saber account and agree to every rights violation and security compromising spyware installation that just occurred, which is severely frustrating in that it's also fruitless in accomplishing really anything for the customer.

Secondly - this game's layout for financing doesn't give me very much faith, the available content was short and the DLC was sold as a VERY expensive pre-order bonus for a very full price game that we're expecting cosmetics and other cash grabs for, this leaves me with the bitter taste of every other game that sold something of a quarter of what it could be and then proceeded to define their content expansions similar to the expectations of a gas station sandwich, please endeavour to prove this wrong, Saber, as you have a very tall ceiling to reach and very good groundwork underneath you.

Campaign: We tried the first mission (saving the rest for a full day of playing) and we played on highest difficulty. I would say it was challenging enough that you have to play tactically depending on what enemy you face. (in other words, you can't just go full melee and just press attack button, that will kill you...fast). Final verdict for Campaign: Really looking forward to see how the story unfolds!

PvE Mission: Tried 1 mission with 2 random players. It was a fair amount of challenge, sometimes you felt overwhelmed by the enemies & that you really had to play around your teammates to even be able to succeed which is a good thing. But most of the time it was a walk in the park. Final verdict: Want to try more missions, see if we can bump up the difficulty a bit here (hard to know after 1 mission tho).

PvP: AMAZING, it is so much fun, feels super rewarding to play & i can imagine this will be great with a full stack of 6 players in ranked mode. Final verdict: Please add a ranked mode and this will be perfect!

Customization: This is really where the game excels! For those who are not in to 40k, the customization is like halo3/halo reach custom but on STEROIDS. So many options, so much to unlock! If you like customization this will make you happy! Final verdict: Perfection!

Is it great though? No, not really.

Space Marine 2 is somewhat a throwback to the old times where games were fun. Don't get me wrong this game is the EPITOMY of fun. It's fast, it's flashy, the mechanics are great. Alas this game still feels somewhat being in the last decade of game design. The bots are still dumb, their pathfinding is atrocious, and the enemies wait for you in an never ending cacophony of chaos.

The game is beatiful for the most part and one has to keep his jaw closed or face the consequences. Alas there are some cutbacks here and there, some clipping, some missing stuff (a very major character has his belt feeding mechanism missing).

The game is rich in lore and if you're a fan of Space Marines (and especially Ultramarines) you won't want to leave the Barge, because it feels like home.

I give it a big yes, but there is still lot of room for improvement.

I can wholeheartedly say that it tickles every inch of my 40k nerd brain. The story, while not a masterstroke in narrative design, is exactly what it needed to be for a Space Marine story. It took me roughly 9-10 hours playing on normal, while doing a bit of dense exploration here and there. It is a spectacle through and through, you couldn't ask for more.

The game looks phenomenal, runs smooth as butter on my mid-tier system and plays like a dream. The first Space Marine game is very nostalgic, but I don't think it holds a candle to its successor. I've yet to try out the PVP modes, I'm not much of a PVP guy, but the PVE is extremely fun, if a bit limited in scope. With only six operations at launch that only differ slightly in enemy numbers, variants and spawns, I feel as though it may get a bit stale over time. The Devs have stated that new free operations will be on the way so I look forward to that.

I think this game is a very, very solid 9/10. I can see myself playing this for hours and hours if the Devs perfect the amazing base they have here. All in all, if you're a fan of 40k, love mowing down tons of enemies of Mankind and want to experience a superb power fantasy, this is the game for you.

This game is the best warhammer 40k game since the original space marine. I completed the campaign in around 9 hours solo on normal. The operations( the online pve mode) is a lot of fun and enjoyable. The eternal war mode(the pvp mode) is a lot of fun balance seems to be pretty descent. The only complaint i have with pvp is my party members never seem to understand how to go hold a point in some of the modes.

Graphically the game is absolutely beautiful.
Combat is really fun but getting use to using two weapons at once is a challenge.
The sheer amount of mobs you fight is insane and with no lag.

The only draw backs currently are there are some minor bugs i have noticed like my custom armor not keeping my chapter mark on my bulwark(so far it's only this class.) There has been some minor connection issues but they are few and far between for me.

Steam says I have 21 hours in the game, but probably 6 of those were AFK and another 2 were spent messing around in multiplayer and dealing with some crashes on the initial cutscene. Overall, I guess the main story probably took me ~13 hours to beat, and I tried to be pretty thorough about exploring maps and listening to all the dialogue. The game that is here is very good, and it uses enough memorable setpieces for most encounters to feel interesting and unique. The early Tyranid encounters and the entire last mission are especially fantastic. They really succeeded at making you feel like a space marine, although there were some times where I felt a little more like John Dark Souls roll-spamming through enemy fire. My main complaint is just that the story felt a bit flat. Not necessarily short, rather it felt like a somewhat simple story which was a little disappointing considering the various intelligent agents at play. I haven't touched the Operations (Co-Op content) yet though, so it's possible that adds some nuance to the story. I played on the apparent intended difficulty and it felt very well balanced with the exception of one specific tyranid encounter. The combat feels great, the game looks awesome, and the small bit of Co-Op I played was very fun (aside from the very long load times), I'm definitely going to try and grind this game to get all the cool cosmetics and whatnot, but I can't help but be reminded of MGSV with its abruptly short ending compensated for with a questionably integrated ""endless"" multiplayer mode.",Recommended,1310,50.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

ScratchBOT3000,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ScratchBOT3000/,"After 13 years of waiting, Titus returns to destroy everything xenos and heretic for the glory of Ultramar and the Imperium. And he freaking rocks !

At the time of writing this review I'm almost 5 hours into the game and have only touched the campaign mode with my friends in coop. However, it has already proved itself as a true continuation of the game from my childhood.
From the visual standpoint the game looks brilliant and everything, that will surround you, will absolutely feel like 40k and will immerse you till the end.
Sound Design is also impressive, from firing bolters to the crunching bones and flesh of your enemies. Yes, sometimes it can be loud af and if you play in coop you won’t be able to hear your teammate, but that’s the whole fun of it.
Gameplay, in comparison to the first game, did see some major improvements and feels more dynamic and enjoyable (sometimes even hard, even on normal difficulty). Additionally the possibility to play the entirety of the campaign with your friends increases the scale of fun by 10.
I won’t be writing about the story this much, because I'm still going thru it, but I will say that the story is engaging. Just seeing Titus once again reintegrating himself into his Chapter after such a long time and the reactions of people on his past feels interesting. The rest of campaign you will have to discover on your own, but believe me, you won’t regret it.

The only minor problem that I have currently encountered was the connection to the Space Marine 2 servers and I had to reconnect to them several time in my ~5 hours of gameplay. But as I said, it was a minor problem that will probably be fixed in the future. Or maybe I just need to speed up my Internet connection, I don't know :P

Anyway, was these 13 years worth the wait ? Yes. Should you play this game just to enjoy the slaughterhouse that is happening there ? Also yes. And if you are a 40k fan, then Yes x10.

I currently rate it a solid 9/10 and claim it as a worthy successor to the previous game.

IvoCliff,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IvoCliff/,"Alright now that ive put some time into it I want to give a honest review.

Im only going to be talking about negatives, *real negatives* not stuff like no ultra wide support on launch. Because for the most part, if you look at the trailers and go “yo that looks cool”, thats all you really need to know for positives. The game lives up the expectations.

1. Campaign length. I thought the campaign was good, better than sm1, but I played on tier 4 difficulty and did the operations when they unlocked (you can do pre campaign, but theres a spoiler warning) and it took me 12 hours. Without the operations and on normal, id estimate its only 6-7 hours which is what others suggest.

I think its a good campaign, but 8 hours would have probably been the sweet spot.

2. Pvp chaps customization is lacking, and we are currently missing thousand sons, emperors children, and word bearers. Hopefully they will come with class releases which would be free, but to all my thousand son brothers yeah it sucks.

Furthermore, your actual options are paint and emblems. No physical changes. I get loyalist getting more fashion because of pve, but it would be nice if we could have 1 legion specific armor set per class and 2 general chaos armor sets to mix and match.

3. Pvp only has 3 maps. The pvp is super fun, im actually playing more pvp than I am pve which is very surprising, but its a shame there are only 3 maps. 3 is the minimum but 5 would feel much better and it wont be till early 2025 when we get more.

4. Assault in pve. In the campaign and pvp, you have a super fast recharge on your jump pack. Furthermore you can really sore high into the sky. Yet in pve operations, for some reason the assault class has super slow regen, and barely goes up maybe 4 space marines high.

Now, I get nerfing the regen a bit compared to pvp. In pvp its risky to be in the air and no ground slam can instakill versus pve where its a good escape tool and is great for swarms, but it should be a minor increase in cooldown. I assume it will get buffed as its considered the only “weak” class by the community rn, but if you are a Blood Angel or Raven Guard fan, you may be disappointed.

————
Thats really it. Again, gameplay is great, music pretty good, story actually good (not sure how good to someone who doesnt know 40k but I assume it isn’t bad), operations are fun and the classes all feel good. Pvp is surprisingly really fun, as someone who expected to ignore it. Visuals are great and do 40k justice.

Basically its worth the money, but I wanted to go over some of the negatives from a perspective of someone who likes the game.",Recommended,2144,37.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

YES for Campaign and PVE
NO for PvP

Good Continuation of the Story. Similar type of combat that you will not be too lost. Amazing graphic and expansion on the Lore.

Negative side would be some performance aspect. But we rarely get a AAA game like this anymore. The speed at which you engage or disengage your weapon sight to switch to melle attack is way too slow and leads to frustration. Like every 3rd person shooter fighting near walls leads to view being block of glitch. A true Single player experience that can be continued with the Multiplayer.

PvE is a campaign with friends or pub. You play some of the same missions of the campaign or some of the mission the other Squads you hear about during the story are doing. It's a great idea.

I miss the Orks but the Tyranids were fun to smash.

PVP is very bad and already empty. Way worse than the first game. Your space marine are slow so slow. there is no kill cam and half the time it looks like we were shot through a wall. if you don' t like a game where snipers dominate don't play this.

I miss the Ork vs Marine because there was a real difference in colours and weapons on the arena. now it's just a bunch of space marine that all look the same with the same gear. it's very clunky and remind me of Gears of War with the constant rolling to dodge bullet.",Recommended,1101,19.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Space Marine 2 is an extremely based intolerant brutal religiously zealous male super soldier power fantasy, and it's friggin awesome. The combat is righteously satisfying; every bolter shot feels meaty and impactful, every chainsword slash is heavy and visceral. The attention to detail of the game world is amazingly immersive, the game just looks phenomenal. The story and characters are very well written, strong loyal men of honor and duty. It's very cool to see the Warhammer 40k universe so faithfully, lovingly, and lore-accurately recreated in such a way for us to experience digitally.

adrianpras,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adrianpras/,"Great Game but it definitely needs some ironing out.
Operations mode is really fun but just from playing it on the lowest difficulty as you start out, the ammunition is so low especially in your reserve, some weapons dont have this and just have one continuous stockpile, on the higher difficulties you'll find even less ammo around the maps
you're always looking for ammo some weapons in particular start out with even less ammo and the maximum amount you can hold is atrocious. In a horde shooter this shouldnt be such an issue, a lot of these 40k games like this one put a lot of emphasis on the melee combat but even then you wont always break the tougher enemies guard with heavy attacks, they can even keep hitting you and your dodge and parry doesnt always register, theyre relentless and again Ive just started out and arent a high level in any of the classes, my highest being a 7. I cant imagine how this'll pan out on the higher dfficulties and you WILL have to play them if you want to keep upgrading the classes and weapons. Just liker Helldivers 2 there are upgrade ""tokens"" to be found the better ones you need are on the top 2 difficulties.
Any enemy that isnt a grunt is its own tank and they spawn these just as much as the grunts, theyre so tanky all your ammo will be depleted before youve killed half of them, that'll again be even worse as you turn the difficulty higher.
They need to make adjustments, I get theres supposed to have a challenge but we're space marines after all and this doesnt feel like we are anything special, the cooldown to regenerating your armour/shields also feels like like a lifetime.

While the game looks visually incredible, the performance isnt the best, unless you dropped several grand on a PC youre not gonna run this game all high or ultra, Im usually at 60 FPS with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, RTX 3070, and 32 GB RAM, I dont think this system is low spec at all. DLSS does a minimal job at helping and I do not play with it on anything else then Performance

The game is an incredible grind, you will drop over 100 hours to unlock all the customisation and upgrade your classes across the board since the same currency used for unlocking customisation and upgrading your perk trees in every single character

All in all I love this game so far but it needs adjustments to the grind, enemies/combat, and performance. I do like that they have a whole roadmap with future modes and maps etc coming in the near future before the year end and onwards

TheFallenKnight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFallenKnight/,"Super new to the Warhammer franchise. Been interested for quite a while though, because of all the YouTube shorts about Warhammer lore that's been flooding my algorithm. So my review will be in the perspective of someone new to the franchise so don't forget to take that in mind.

The Story/Campaign will delve shortly about the main characters backstory, so if you're worrying that you didn't manage to play the prequel game fear not as you will be given backstory, regarding what happened before this game. I delve shortly on the PVE feature of the game as I wanted to finish the main story first to better understand the plot of the game. But for the couple of runs testing out the different classes, I enjoyed every play-style, as they differ with each other. So I highly suggest to play with your friend to make an ideal team as your lineup can really affect the flow of your game, specially on higher difficulty.

Basically to make things short, the plot of the story is so good, that I genuinely didn't notice how many hours I've been playing, the characters, and the flow of the plot kept me playing, the co-op PVE side of the game will give you the satisfaction of finishing each runs. Being able to hammer down your enemies from the sky, is pure testosterone, or showering your enemies in heavy fire, or even parrying your enemies foolish ploy to harm you. This is one of the only
pre-order I've made that I didn't regret getting, not even one bit. You can see the passion, and dedication that the developers poured into this game. Hopefully you can experience this soon. Expecting more contents, possible expansion packs (yep definitely not regretting suggesting more expansion for the game, that's just how f****** good the game is), and even unlockable cosmetics in the near future.

This has now become one of my favorite games of all time. And I haven't even finished the story yet!

Few things to note however, armor customization could be a little better. I want my Crimson Fists armor to be accurate. But in order to even have Crimson fists, you have to paint the entire arm red which is weird. I'd like the customization to be a little bit more precise.

Next is the load times. They are super super long and when you get into a match, it is either someone kicking you or quitting the lobby. THEN ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN. Not ideal to say the least.

It boggles my mind that so many players have left negative reviews because of that alone which has nothing to do with the game itself.

In all honesty, and as someone who works in the gaming industry, I do not know how they built the tech into this game but its phenomenal. For context, I play on a pretty old PC using a 2080 RTX. From early performance benchmarks, I was dreading booting the game at home. To my surprise, the game ran extremely smooth! Unbelievably smooth. The Swarm Tech really makes you feel like you're in a huge battle despite the game play area being much smaller. They seriously captured the Warhammer 40k fantasy in this game.

The multiplayer aspect is fun with friends, higher difficulties need better coordination and use of abilities to succeed well
The PVP aspect still needs some balancing as well but it's fun to experience the modernized version of an old Titles PVP

The core game needs some optimization to run better but all in all it's a pretty solid 8/10 for myself
Any issues it has i hope they'll optimize and fix overtime
And in terms of cosmetics i do hope they add more since wanting to create certain stuff is limited by the Mark X pattern, would be nice to have some Corvus pattern armor parts as well as some other first born armor pieces cause why not, Also more helmets with various lens colors would also be nice, don't want to nit pick too much but there is potential here so just have to wait and see.",Recommended,826,45.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

My kid self would be geeking over the cinematics, the gameplay, the story, the EMPEROR. If you aren't into 40k, I could see why some people think this is some generic third person shooter, but everything in this game makes you feel so good. Its something a Warhammer fan will absolutely appreciate and adore. I hope it brings new fans!

It seems like it will be short and that's fine with me, I feel like the first 3 hours have given me everything I could ask for in a game like this, I felt like a space marine, I stomped down enemies, blasted with friends, contemplated heresy....and jetpacks with chainswords!?

The combat is simple, gruesome and highly entertaining. Some hybrid mix between doom and gears of war. This game isn't Darktide, although it does make me want to hop back in. The story so far is surprisingly good and made me care about the characters quick.

Recommend to anyone who has any slight interest in feeling like a 7.5 ft space marine, decorated head to toe in ornamental, glorious armor and get to use all sorts of giant death raining weapons, experience huge war scenes, save the little guardsmen, just engross yourself in the 40k lore. Its very over the top, extreme religions, constant wars..

I see some others arguing over whether the games content is light for 60$, while I somewhat agree from my initial impressions with there being only two main ""modes"", I think the games polish and how its made me feel, makes it worthwhile to me. People have different expectations for what constitutes a 60$ game and I get that. I do feel like some have lost sight on how far we have come with games.

1: There is no chaos marine customization atm and no guarantee on the roadmap that itll come. Its a bummer yes, it is way too unfair to judge the entire game on this alone.
2: Performance issues, I can confidently say the people who have performance issues and complain about it are the ones who do not have proper specs for this game or are trying to play it at way too high of graphics. I have not had a single issue neither has my friend and we are both running on high to max settings.

Highly recommend this game, combat is great, the campaign has been fantastic so far blast from the past of space marine 1. For the emperor.

Edit: Open finishing the campaign and playing pvp here are some current thoughts. I never came across any bugs of any sort, overall currently feeling incredibly polished rare optimization issues maybe a very very occasional .5 second frame drop but thats if i was being picky. Otherwise, campaign is certainly a little bit short, however it is still a great story, great cinematic moments, and a HUGEEEEE blast with friends, ai companions are sometimes a little lack luster but they will certainly go the mile to revive you so no harm there.

I have yet to play 3 person operations yet, however the 6v6 PVP is a blast. Classes feel pretty balanced and theyre all fun to play, my only wish was that crossplay was an option for 6v6 as one of my friends will be getting this game on PS5 and wants to play with the rest of my friend group when we all can.

Overall impression: 9/10 game with the -1 being for a shortish campaign, no chaos marine customization (which I believe will probably change at somepoint its not on the roadmap but the system is already in place for it in game) and there being only 6 pve missions which I know will change with free ones down the line.",Recommended,1536,46.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

Pros:
- Great 40k vibes,
- Power fantasy of playing as a Space Marine,
- Great cinematics and in-game scenes,
- Gun and melee feel good,
- PvE missions tied to the campaign.

Cons:
- Campaign is quite short (something around 8 hours - 12 hours if you also play PvE missions),
- Shooting from the hip is pointless - zero accuracy,
- One bad single-player level (you need to use a flamethrower to scare enemies, but at certain moments flying enemies appear and bots have problems fighting them),
- PvE missions tied to the campaign - yes, this is a double-edged sword.

My concern (review written post-credit scene with minimal multiplayer experience):
I have a feeling PvE without big updates will quickly become super boring - missions are railroaded a lot. It is a plus during the campaign, but I don't feel any randomization here - same bosses, same places. If they add some more missions and a way to randomize them - like some diffrence in map it could be great.",Recommended,847,15.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

76561198256697089,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256697089/,"Summary:
-Campaign is a fun, classic, 12ish hour romp for single player third person shooter fans. Co-op with friends is a plus
-PvP is fun but shallow, some classes obviously better than others (melee just isn't very good for obvious reasons)
-Operations (PvE co-op missions) are odd, a little awkward to play, and at times boring, but they're fun if you have friends to play with and they are likely to get a lot of attention in future updates as the devs decide what to make this game into post-launch

This game is in a very odd place at launch. As a single-player 3rd person shooter focusing just on campaign, it's a pretty classic 8-12ish hour experience, and it's done very well. There's a mission or two in campaign that I consider stinkers (mission 2 with the pyreblaster) but overall the campaign skips along at a good pace and is very fun in a way that's reminiscent of games like gears of war, spec ops the line, and other third-person shooter classics. Good set-pieces, pretty good pacing, fun weapons, and shockingly cool and fun boss fights (again, minus mission 2's boss. the lictor as a boss doesn't work very well imo, and I just don't like mission 2 lol). The campaign builds up to an AWESOME finale with a final boss fight that feels like something out of kingdom hearts 2.

Then you finish the campaign - and you're prompted to try out the other game modes which will obviously be the focus of the devs moving forward. With a season pass they are clearly trying to keep this game alive post launch as a multiplayer experience both in co-op operations and pvp. The pvp is kinda shallow but fun, while the operations are... very hard to rate right now. I like op 2: ""decapitation"" but the others all feel very generic, gimmicky, and shallow somehow. Not being able to switch around weapons like titus, not having access to his ""ult"" which they call ""abilities"" in this game, being locked into a specific playstyle (unless you pick an all-rounder class like tactical marine) for an entire mission, set-piece and enemy scripting that was very obviously a lower priority than the bombastic, crazy campaign. It all just feels second-rate.

I dunno. the operations feel weird, and for some reason they gimped the assault class to only jump a singular foot off the ground in this mode unlike the 30 foot jump you do in campaign and pvp.

Overall the campaign is worth $60 in today's market imo. It's great and games like this don't get made any more. It feels like these devs revived a lost art from the late 2000s. The other modes are an after-thought to me. Take em or leave em, see what they turn into down the line.",Recommended,2169,32.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

piscisknight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/piscisknight/,"I'm giving this the thumbs up, but its actually a neutral.

It's hard for me to objectively review this game without thinking constantly of the ""what it could be"". So that taints my POV. After playing games like Helldivers which captures perfectly what is a ""galaxy wide"" conflict, I suffer seeing Space Marine with such an old formula. I know the game is not pretentious and it tried to focus on visual imapct and action, but those too have a really steep diminshing return rule in the pleasure they provide. For a $60++ game, that feels lackluster.

Also, this game took over 13 years to arrive. Production took multiple years. It got delayed almost one year. And this is what we got? Sorry, it was not enough. I applaud the effort, but no guys, this was not the game we deserved.

The Pros:

- Visuals, we all agree on that
- Lore, its really respectful of the lore, but at the same time not annoying for the newcomers
- Sounds (not soundtrack), they are on point

The Bads:

- Combat is just...messy, and not in the good way of messy as chaotic-fun. Its more chaotic-evil lol. You will read it everywhere. Ranged combat is not encouraged at all and actually a detriment to you. QTEs and parry system gets lost immediatly as soon as you get swarmed. Also telegraphs sometimes show up, sometimes they don't. Sometimes you have to time based on animations, sometimes it won't work.

- PvE gets boring ASAP. Operations is a one trick pony. Progression is non existent and just a fake front.

- PvP is atrocious. Was it THAT HARD to add a layer of Galaxy Wide conflict between chaos and loyalist? Playing 5 minutes TDM-like matches its just a WASTE for a game with the potential this one had. Why not add some PvE content inside the PvP? Was it really necessary to make simetric maps like if this was actually gonna be a ""competitive"" game? 3 maps? Why not reuse assets of the campaign to make more? It feels so sadly basic.

- Having only two enemy factions is meh. I think with the development time and production this game had, you guys could've gone the extra mile to add more. I was so hyped when I was in the final world expecting a surprise there, and you guys let me down so much not seeing ""those"" enemies show up.

So all in all, I would recommend this game, but not at full price. And I would mostly recommend it to die hard fans of WH40K, or people who just wanna have 10-12 hs of fun for what they pay.",Recommended,1980,38.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

Dodging some enemy attacks, like AoE flames or charges, doesn’t always work correctly. Even when you dodge, you can still get hit, which feels unfair and needs fixing.

Some enemies, like flying Tyranids, are hard to deal with if you’re using melee-focused classes. These classes don’t have the right weapons or enough ammo, making these fights feel unbalanced.

Healing with melee weapons is much weaker than with ranged weapons like the Multi-Melta, which can heal a lot of contested health quickly. Melee healing should be better, given the risk of fighting up close.

Chaos Warriors are annoying to fight at higher difficulties because they teleport too much and seem to cheat by knowing your moves. They need limits on their teleporting to make them more fun to fight.

The Assault class is supposed to be good at melee but has clunky dodge mechanics. You can't cancel attacks into a dodge, making it hard to avoid damage. The jetpack is also less useful in operations mode than in the story, which should be fixed to keep it consistent and powerful.

Ranged weapons like the Multi-Melta and Las Fusil are much stronger than any melee weapons, making melee combat almost useless. Melee weapons need a big damage boost to make them worth using.

There is no place for weakness or will not to fight there is only courage and honor. As it were I was chosen as a death angel to shatter earth to its core with my Thunder Hammer and crush every heretic skull and bone into dust.
There are some games that its hard to describe and give every best possible light on the spot but this is one of those games that you have to play it and experience raw primal creation. The first game was already pretty rad but this one gives another level of satisfaction.
Story follows out hero Titus and hes hard and brutal road to salvation. By the time you end this magnificent journey you will know what truly brotherhood means. Warhammer world is harsh and deadly but you will know the first minute you step inside this hell hole. Fighting xenos at first is hard and unfair but when you craft your hands into a deadly force nothing will stop the inevitable.
Gameplay is super satisfying loop of never ending blood bath. Very hard to stop the train of destruction. Whats crazy about it that more you go the more you powerful get. Developers did fantastic job by letting you become powerhouse. Tons of bad big heavy guns that are just screaming to pick them up and try it. Sure flamethrowers are sh*t in this game compared to others but who needs flamethrower when you have Thunder Hammer. Who needs bullets when you have godlike creation in your hands. Just one more swing and it will be over. I never felt that powerful like this. But of course there are other classes to chose for you and campaing to finish with friends. Plus dedicated side stories that adds more to the story and multiplayer that gives more hours. Best to experience this game would be with co op friends. Hard is douable but beyond that is a bit overtuned nightmare.
No hick ups or issues with running the game. Maybe one thing that bugs me off is that pve and pvp unlocks are separate as entity.

AnaThemis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnaThemis/,"Pretty good, but It's lacking overall in content right now to justify the full price. After 12 hours of gameplay, I've mostly seen all the new stuff there is to see and at this point now have the choice of grinding to higher difficulties and gear to get to harder difficulties or play the PVP. There's a lack of secondary weapons, and such, but the spectacle is just so incredible and the actual missions themselves are pretty fun. There's a fair variety of objectives, but I can't imagine just wanting to run through the same missions so I can run through them again with the same gun with a stat upgrade for all that long until I am going to need another game play loop to really keep me invested over the long term. For Comparison I found Darktide fairly disappointing and wouldn't hugely recommend it, I think at least better uses the fewer maps they have by varying up the mission types and conditions somewhat.

So why do I recommend it? Well for one, because steam does not do mixed reviews. But also because the stuff it does right I really enjoy. Some people don't like the combat style but I really love it, especially in the coop mode where, due to being a bit more specialised in your fighting style, has a flow that I really enjoy. The campaign itself is just a fun blast too, and whilst the story is a bit of a let down (especially because it ends on a very ""to be continued"" ending that just doesn't feel great) the mission to mission gameplay is incredible. It feels like fighting through a war and really delivers on the power fantasy.

Overall I recommend this game if you know what you're getting into, but if you're tight on cash- maybe skip this one for something that is overall better value for money.",Recommended,1410,14.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

76561198011953902,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011953902/,"Let's make this review not for fans!

I'll immediately note that the campaign should be perceived as a large tutorial for a network game (!)
The campaign has a serious drawback that can affect the first impression, especially in a game with maximum difficulty, these are your 2 partners (BOTS) who are absolutely stupid, so ideally it is better to find 2 more in the party who can replace them, including in the Steam community on Warhammer 40000

First, this is the second decent game on Warhammer since 2011(Space Marine I) after Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader (2023), which in turn is the first quality product for non-fans of the series for 20 years (from Dawn of War (2004))

Here is everything to get acquainted with the series The Imperium of Man and the Space Marines and the mechanics of their relationships within the order and not only.

Everything is done qualitatively from the graphics and the presentation of plans in the background during the battle to the sounds and voice acting directly in all languages (!)

The game also has an operations mode. In essence, the same campaign, only forced fortunately with 2 other players, the events there unfold for another squad in parallel with the main plot. There you can choose, as in the network game, one of 6 classes.

Saber Interactive has done a great job of introducing the product to a new audience unfamiliar with the universe.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Давайте сделаем этот обзор не для фанатов!

Сразу отмечу, что кампанию стоит воспринимать как большой туториал для сетевой игры (!)
У кампании есть серьезный недостаток, который может повлиять на первое впечатление, особенно в игре на максимальной сложности, это ваши 2 напарника (БОТА), которые абсолютно тупые, поэтому в идеале лучше найти в пати еще 2, которые смогут их заменить, в том числе в сообществе Steam по Warhammer 40000

Для начала, это вторая приличная игра по Warhammer с 2011 года после Warhammer 4000 Rogue Trader (2023), которая в свою очередь является первым качественным продуктом для не фанатов серии за 20 лет (начиная с Dawn of War'a (2004))

Здесь есть все для знакомства с серией - Империумом Человечества и Космическими Десантниками а так же механикой взаимоотношения внутри ордена и не только.

Все сделано качественно от графики и подачи планов на фоне во время боя до звуков и озвучки сразу на всех языках(!)

В игре есть и режим операций. По сути та же кампания, только нас принуждают к счастью к игре с 2 другими игроками, события там разворачиваются за другой отряд параллельно основному сюжету. Там можно выбрать, как и в сетевой игре, один из 6 классов.

My only complaint is that special enemies are a little bit too tanky on higher difficulties (headshots don't really do anything compared to mag dumping) and that your squadmate AI are as dumb as a bag of bricks and are incapable of picking up in game weapons and items. Those are my only complaints so far.

The game itself is super fun and can get surprisingly challenging at times! I definitely recommend it if you've been looking for a decent linear 3rd person action shooter hack and slash horde game. There's also a multiplayer mode that I hope will get a bunch of content updates and will last longer than the 1st game's PvP mode.",Recommended,705,14.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 5
Xanarkan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xanarkan/,"Looking for a polished horde-melee/shooter on rails similar to Darktide and set in the same universe? You've come to the right place. What this game tries to do, it does well.

Combat is a visceral rotation of parrying blue melee, dodging red melee, clearing trash swarms, breaking armor, seeking snipers, and of course clicking on heads. While you may be a Space Marine, unfortunate budget cuts across the Imperium have resulted in a shortage of power armor. Instead, you'll have to wear that paper-mache cosplay you made for last year's convention. This naturally means a good defense is a good offense, and that only by bathing in the blood of your enemies can you hope to maintain your health and cosplay. Blood for the Emperor, Skulls for the Golden Throne.

- Aesthetic, audio, and voice acting are well done and on-brand.
- Weapons mostly feel like they carry weight and pack a punch.
- Music is fitting, though nothing as epic as Jesper Kyd's work on the 'tide games. Most of the time I forgot it was there.
- Bot intelligence of your fellow marines in singleplayer story leaves something to be desired. This primarily has to do with where they choose to position themselves, engagement range, and target priorities. Their one saving grace after they abandon your side and the objective is that they'll come pick you up directly if you suffer a mortal wound.
- In some stages, hordes can be delayed or thinned by targeting the piles they build to scale walls, much like piles the bugs build in Starship Troopers. Cool feature, and generally it's easier to tell the direction waves are coming from. Generally.
- When I describe the game ""on rails,"" I mean that the maps you play through are generally a series of corridors, catwalks, and confined spaces. You might see sweeping vistas and even shoot hordes as they cascade over the hills to your position, but most of that space is for them to run on, not you. There is little to offer in terms of exploration.

All that said, if you don't like being led by the nose or would rather play something tactical, thought-provoking and innovative, you'll want to look elsewhere or at least wait for it to go on sale.",Recommended,1795,2.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

etrnl_frost,https://steamcommunity.com/id/etrnl_frost/,"What it is: A love letter to WH40k fans looking for a lore friendly option of a long standing persistent grim dark future fantasy creation from the early 1980's.

What it isn't: A standalone best of in the genre that feels 100% complete instead of a somewhat grindy, almost live service-y game.

First off, do you have your copy of the Lectitio Divinitatus handy, guardsman? WELL PUT THAT FILTH AWAY, FOR THIS GAME SPEAKS TO THE SONS OF THE EMPEROR... 's sons...

The presentation, is - flat out - flawless. The dedication to the environments, the sky boxes, the feel of overwhelming numerical superiority from the enemy; the touches from the executed Rubicae, the screech of Binaric cant when you pass tech priests in the halls of your wonderfully gothic battle barge; it's ALL there.
Much like the world building in Darktide, the developers here spared nothing when it came to drilling deep into the detail of the lore.
From the moment the first cinematic has you load into the tutorial, grab your seat - you're in for a ride.
The nods to the lore-hungry are everywhere. Expect the game to provide, in engine, things that you would have always dreamed of. The first time you saw those space marines hoisting their standard in a last stand over their enemies on the cover of ... well, pick a White Dwarf - yeah. They know their audience.

If you're a fan of the series; every cut of the power sword, every thump of your thunder hammer; the squish of organs under your power fists and the splatter of your bolt rounds feels like a delectably bespoke optical and aural experience for the WH40k fandom. This is a game that was made for you - as long as you like space marines.

It is not without its faults. While the game play loop is enjoyable in its visceral nature, you can't help but feel like the game is incomplete. Sure, the roadmap promises more, and one can argue that the hallmark of a good game is that it leaves one with the desire for more - and while there is longevity in the RNG nature of the Operations, and PvP; the customization (looking at you, chaos) leaves a bit to be desired and the grind feels artificial at best. Also, why is there only a bionic arm? What about the legs? And why can't I do both arms and both legs? Just the one right arm? Really? Nitpicking, sure, but there it is.

Layers upon layers of complication affect the unlock system, whether it's trying to determine which weapons need what xp or what specific currencies are required to unlock weapon or class perks. While the perks are clearly defined, their measurable effects vary from slight to game changing. Not to mention the drip of materials and xp from the missions themselves, and you can find even the best gameplay loop can wear thin pretty fast.

All in all, it's a stellar throwback to games and masculinity of a time long past. It's nostalgia layered with lore in a perfect serving that doesn't sit too long.

If you are a fan of the lore, buy it. If you are not; try it. If you think space men are silly, watch a broadcast. It's an acquired taste, sure; but if you have acquired the taste, it would be very hard to do better.",Recommended,2571,54.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561197988609440,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988609440/,"A sequel 10+ years in the making and it doesn't disappoint.

Space marine takes up the story the original 2010 game left for us, following the adventures of (former) captain Titus of the Ultramarines. Its been a while in the setting too, a century even and alot has happened in the lore to bring our intrepid ultramarine to the new standard of heros in the current canon.

The gameplay is largely similar yet its been evolved. Those who played the original might almost frustratingly feel so close to the original yet the new mechanics get in the way...this is wrong and you'll shake the feeling off before the tutorial is over. The new mechanics are solid and once you get the timing down and general learning curve of the melee system it can feel natural at times. theres some timing issues i think still need hammering out but these are the early days and patches will come along with additional content that has been promised.

The story is great and i actually laughed when i saw what they were doing with it having played the original again shortly before this dropped. Any veteran will get a sensible chuckle as well i surmise, this isn't a bad thing at all. Theres a grander narrative focus here, we get more of a view inside Titus's head now, it feels like we have more writing talent behind it than back in 2010 and it comes off nice as the visuals which are fantastic.
Its easy to get lost in the carnage of combat both near and far as you can see massive battles going on in the distance, guard lines barely holding against a tide of blue and grey monsters.

And all of it in a package less than 70 gigs and can run on older hardware with little issue. Optimization here is good, not perfect but good. Some complain of server issues with its extensive coop mode and others complain of the difficulty spikes the campaign throws out. One will be ironed out in time the other is a filter for heretics.

Space Marine 2 is a proper nod to the might of Space Marines and a proper nod to the 40k universe as a whole, its another step in a growing trend of seeing the franchise break away from being purely a RTS or other strategy series and into somthing bloodier.

Gameplay lets you feel just as powerful and unstoppable as Space Marine 1 but improves on the clunky off -balance feeling movement, especially in PVP, some sound glitches here and there tho, loosing audio during a few extermination matches but hopefully that gets ironed out in the day 1 patch.

results,https://steamcommunity.com/id/results/,"This game desperately needs a way to adjust the field of view, but has no such option. There are frequent times during game play where you can't even see your entire character model because the FOV is so zoomed in.

The game also lacks HDR support and is using a version of DLSS that's almost 2 years old. No ultrawide monitor support either, despite the game still rendering behind the black bars on 21:9 displays. There's no reason a modern game should be lacking these modern features, or using outdated versions of readily available upscaling technology.

With all those negatives said, the game is still quite fun and I plan to continue playing. But we shouldn't have to hope and pray that the modding community steps in to implement basic features that the developers couldn't be bothered to include.

At first the writing makes it sound like baby's first Warhammer 40k game, and it is. But after a few missions, they finally take the training wheels off when [REDACTED] enter the picture.

If you played the first Space Marine, this is a solid successor serving both as eye-catching on-ramp for those new to Warhammer and love letter to fans. And it shows—they didn't just throw Nurgle in again for the thousandth time.


The Good
As a game, this is without a doubt made to get more people interested in Warhammer. It's a great intro for new players because it is designed for them; oddly frequent moments of lore dumping, really simple terms for stuff with fancier lore names, and so on. Thankfully after a few missions it stops being an overly newb friendly lore tutorial—this game doesn't just exist to grow the fanbase.

visual quality / world building

class / weapon variety

The Bad
no healing from executions(core feature of first game)

huge difficulty spike between difficulty lvs

lacking power fantasy / dont feel like space marine (slow, difficulty reduces health(like why wtf add more enemies and damage or whatever)

awkward mechanics (blocking sucks)

ReevsyIsMe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ReevsyIsMe/,"After over 60 hours of Playing Space Marine 2, getting all 50 achievements and playing all the game modes all I can say is wow!

The game is phenomenal! It met my every expectation and then some! And as a 40k fan I had very high expectations for the game. The 13 year wait was well worth it and the £79.99 for early release was worth every penny!

Campaign:
The campaign is 7-8 hours long and is very well paced, it keeps you engaged and intrigued the entire time with non-stop story and action! The writing of the story is great as well, there is a reveal after beating the campaign that I saw coming from about halfway through my play-through which I only clocked onto because of playing the first game and the incredible writing that the story has. I have heard people say it's too short but I think it's just the right length and doesn't overstay its welcome. The enemy variety is nice and the hack and slash system with a twist is very visceral and fun! But what I enjoy most of all from the gameplay aspects of the story is the boss fights. Space Marine only had one real boss-fight in the game so I didn't know what to expect with this game, but there are a good amount of fun and unique boss-fights in Space Marine 2. I really enjoy the arena design and the bosses attacks and patterns which truly makes each boss a delight to fight. The game is well worth the price for the campaign alone.

Operations (Co-op PvE):
The Operations mode is very fun to play alone or with some friends, the 6 current Operations missions are great to play and each have their own unique aesthetic and style to them. There's also more boss-fights in Operations as well as some bosses from the campaign showing up occasionally as well. The 6 classes are unique and fun to play and each have their own playstyles. The class I've primarily been using is the Bulwark, which once you get to the max level he just becomes an unstoppable tank that has good crowd control and can turn choke points into death traps with his perks that makes him drop a shock grenade at his feet when he perfectly parries a blow or loses all his armour. I have dabbled in the other classes and they all have their own fun ways to play them and I look forward to levelling them up and seeing what they can do. The Operations mode also runs alongside the story narratively, further adding to the story and making you feel like you're involved in the main story and that it's not just Titus, Gadriel and Chairon advancing the plot. With the plans to add a prestige system, more missions and potentially new classes like the Apothecary in the future the Operations mode looks like it's only going to get better as time progresses.

Eternal War (6v6 PvP):
The Eternal War mode is Space Marine 2's PvP game-mode, it includes Annihilation (Team Deathmatch), Seize Ground (Domination) and Capture And Control (Hardpoint). All 3 of the modes are very fun and the 6 classes from Operations are balanced well for PvP in this mode. There's only a handful of maps at the moment and the mode feels bare-bones but I have to say I like it like that. There's no meta chasing or min-maxing builds to give you an unfair edge in a fight, what wins matches is good team play and martial ability. There will be new game-modes and maps added in the future along with new weapons like the Neo-Volkite Pistol. It also has the potential to be a very fun mode that you can just hop into for a few hours and have some fun.

Customisation:
The customisation is incredible for both the PvP and PvE modes, there's a plethora of different options to customise your marine. The only issue I have at the moment is that the Heretic Astartes are limited in what they can do to customise their classes looks, however I feel that is something Saber will add in a later update alongside even more cosmetic items for us to pimp out our Space Marine's with.

With all that being said I'm going to have Space Marine 2 an 11/10! It's my Game Of The Year for 2024! I have enjoyed every second of this game and shall continue to do so! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fun time! And if you feel like you need to be a Warhammer 40,000 fan to enjoy this game let me tell you that's not the case, you can just hop on and have fun without feeling clueless to the world around you.

If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time to read my review! I hope you have a wonderful day!

Rating: 4/5

Pros:

Stunning Visuals: The game boasts impressive graphics that bring the Warhammer 40,000 universe to life. The environments are richly detailed, and the character models are top-notch.
Engaging Combat: The combat system is fluid and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and abilities that make each encounter thrilling. The melee combat, in particular, feels visceral and impactful.
Immersive Storyline: The narrative is compelling, with well-written dialogue and a plot that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The lore of the Warhammer 40,000 universe is well-integrated, making it a treat for fans.
Sound Design: The audio experience is exceptional, with a powerful soundtrack and sound effects that enhance the overall immersion.
Cons:

AI Squad Issues: While the game is mostly a joy to play, the AI squad can be frustrating, especially on Veteran difficulty. They often make poor tactical decisions, which can lead to unnecessary challenges and detract from the overall experience.
Difficulty Spikes: There are moments where the difficulty spikes unexpectedly, which can be jarring and may require multiple attempts to overcome.
Overall: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a fantastic addition to the franchise, offering a visually stunning and engaging experience. The combat and storyline are highlights, making it a must-play for fans of the series. However, the AI squad’s performance on higher difficulties can be a source of frustration.

If I were to levy any criticism at this game, it's that the Chaos customization for Eternal War is borderline nonexistent, and that Eternal War, in general, needs more love. I've prefer to see larger, more robust maps, and more gamemodes to pad this mode out.

When I was first attempting to log in to the game it was crashing, and I spent probably 2 hours trouble shooting this issue as there was not much support at the time on the issue.
I have since been able to get the game running and play some of the campaign,
It's quite good but I dont think I have enough time in game to make a proper judgement on it at this point.

Original post below.
---------------------------------------------------
First off, I am a huge fan of Space Marine I. I played it a lot and really enjoyed it.
Needless to say I have been waiting for Space Marine II for many years, and was excited to see it finally come available.

It's not a great sign when the very first mission I try crashes on the intro cut scene.
Yeah my game simply will not load past the first cut scene. it freezes and game crashes every time.
But you must be using a toaster for a computer? I hear you say.
No.
I have a RTX 3080 Ti 12gb card, and a decent processor. My computer handles any other recent game and runs it on ultra.

For me so far, unless this is resolved, the game is an expensive wallpaper background.
It's impossible for me to recommend it because I can't even get past the opening cut scene of the game.

It's extremely disappointing because I wanted it to be great, hell even just good would have been enough.

I'm not too sure the multiplayer scene will be around for long, but its a good bit of fun for what it is.

lord_jotnar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_jotnar/,"A 40k Fan's Wet Dream

This game left me absolutely elated. The combat, visuals, soundscape, story all knocked it out of the park. The art team in particular blew it out of the water, and if you're a fan of 40k you will spend quite a lot of time admiring the environment.
Numerous times throughout my play-through I found myself on Games Workshop's webstore debating buying some Tyranid and [REDACTED BY THE INQUISITION] miniatures. The only part of the presentation that wasn't outstanding was the music, which was still really good - just nothing I'll be listening to on Spotify in my day-to-day life.

The story was a marked step up from the first game, with the plot and the character development being far superior. It took me roughly 12 hours to play through the story, however I was on the second hardest difficulty and was also frequently sight-seeing so your mileage may vary.
It is a semi-direct continuation of the first game so while you don't *need* to know what happened there I would look up a plot synopsis or something. MandaloreGaming on Youtube does a decent sparknotes review of the story in his review of the first game.

The multiplayer modes are an absolute joy as they give you an excuse to continue playing with the combat, and customise your own Space Marines.

The only complaints I have are the lack of maps for Operations mode, which will almost certainly be improved with time, the lack of customisation options for Chaos Space Marines in PvP, and the fact that if you play the campaign with helmets on, the characters magically lose their helmets for every cutscene.
These are minor gripes ultimately and in the end this is a solid 9.5/10 for me.",Recommended,1391,24.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

So don't tell me you'll be working on it by the end of the month. Also the servers are a bit weird and getting into the lobby with friends is a pain in the ass and takes a long time. After completing a mission there is a high chance of a 10 minute loading that eventually fails or maybe not. So you have to join in again.

Ignoring the technical status. The gameplay is brutal and enjoyable, the story is amazing so far. It's pretty much everything I wanted this game to be. If you're not sure about buying it wait until the end of the month when S1 and Ultrawide and other patches come out.

PvP takes some getting used to but it's not that big of a problem.

The game plunges players into the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, where there is only war. For fans of Warhammer 40K lore, this game is a dream come true, bringing to life the brutal, gothic grandeur of the universe. Mechanically, the game nails the brutality of 40K combat. Melee engagements feel visceral, with satisfying weight behind each strike, stomp or bash and there are plentiful of enemies to engage.

76561198005585234,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005585234/,"Early Review after only a couple of hours -

Overall - Extremely positive with a few unfortunate drawbacks

Pros:

Combat - Visceral, satisfying and brutal. Well implemented hordes of enemies feel overwhelming in a good way.

Sound - Voice acting, Music and general audio design is fantastic. The game has a great atmosphere and presence.

Visuals- Visually stunning. Enemies, environments and characters are all very detailed and graphically impressive.

Performance - Generally the game runs great on my 4070 and i5-13500. I have had a few dips here and there but nothing major, quite impressive considering the amount of enemies on the screen at any given time and the game looks great too.
I am running the game on Ultra/High on all settings at 1440p with DLSS turned on. The game does not feature frame-gen.

Cons:
One minor complaint is that so far there hasn't been a great deal of variety in combat although its still VERY early days, what there has been has been great and the variety of enemy encounters (if not variety) has kept things interesting and combat is always satisfying.

My only major complaints are:

1. No matchmaking for campaign co-op. There ARE modes with matchmaking but for the campaign you need to use a code to join up with your brothers which, I don't really understand why there is no online group finder or matchmaking for the main campaign

2. Friendly AI is very bad. If you choose to go it alone in the campaign the game will assign you 2 computer controlled marines to form a squad and I'm not exaggerating when I say they are utterly useless.

The game is made far more difficult when you don't group with friends because enemies will rarely target them, instead choosing to swarm the player character in a way that sometimes feels unfair/unbalanced. Meanwhile your AI squadmates will often just stand there doing nothing and you have to fight the majority of enemies on your own.

3. Difficulty feels unbalanced. I started out on Veteran because the game describes it as the ""intended difficulty"" but even some early missions are VERY difficult on this setting, you will die quickly as hundreds of enemies swarm you at once, while ranged enemies peel away your armour quickly.

You can still get through it but expect to have to retry sections frequently. This is compounded by my point above about AI allies doing very little to help, and makes the game a slog even on earlier missions. I restarted on Normal instead and now the game feels far too easy, armour restores more quickly, enemies die much faster and do about a third of the damage as on Veteran, although this is generally a better balance in my opinion and does still provide some challenge.

Summary: Despite being unable to play co-op due to being one of the very few people in my friend group that has pre-purchased the game and there being no public matchmaking for campaign co-op, and some struggles with picking the wrong difficulty setting to start I am still absolutely loving the game so far. Everything about the combat feels satisfying and punchy, the game is very visually impressive and has incredibly impressive performance considering the sheer number of Tyranids that will swarm at one time and the environments and sound design really immerse you in the experience.

76561197976070415,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976070415/,"Thoughts after finishing the campaign:
- Aesthetically Pleasing
- Cinema
- Bolter ASMR
- My pledge is eternal service

If you're a fan of any of these, you'll like this game:
- Space Marine 1
- Warhammer 40k Imperial factions
- Dawn of War 1 intro cinematics
- Astartes
- Deathwatch
- Building/painting/customizing space marines

This absolutely nails the atmosphere of the 40k universe, and really brings to life things you read about in the stories/lore, artwork, and tabletop units (e.g. Spore mines from 4th Edition starter set - ""oh that's cute"" -> in SM2 ""OH TERRA KILL IT WITH FIRE"").

Further breakdown/thoughts:
- Campaign - 11/10 - has taken everything I liked about SM1 and dialed it up to 11, it's bonkers. The intro/tutorial mission goes hard. The attention to detail spread throughout, the little tidbits of conversations in the background etc.
- Operations - It's really neat how these are parallel storylines with the main campaign missions, showing the perspective of the other squads running their objectives. Recommend finishing main campaign first. Note - connectivity is a bit flaky initially - the Devs have already acknowledged this and are working to fix it in the first patch.
- PVP - haven't played this at all yet.
- Overall, to have all these ready at launch, with the upcoming roadmap of content will be free to all players, and the DLC is cosmetics only, this is a solid return to how gaming used to be 10 years ago.


My 2 cents on concerns raised in other reviews:
- Lack of 21:9 support - once getting into the game, this did not detract from my immersion at all. Too busy purging xenos. Devs already have it on the roadmap for the first quarter.
- Epic Online Services being installed - this is typical of many games as part of their backend code and infrastructure to handle crossplay, especially with non-steam platforms. In no way is this forcing you to install or run epic launcher, or login to epic. Aside from some initial connectivity issues in Operations, had several games playing with others on Xbox and Playstation. A battle brother works with the wargear they are given.

- The default binds don't make use of side mouse buttons, so would recommend making use of them as you see fit.

dirtyblacksocks,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtyblacksocks/,"What's below this statement, starting with Clunky Movement, are my initial impressions of the game. After getting through the campaign and actually being able to progress my character, I'm going to switch my review to positive. If you enjoy horde mode games and the Warhammer universe you'll probably enjoy this game. The story is well done. The campaign itself is pretty awful, you feel like you're fighting the combat mechanics as much as you're fighting the enemies. Fortunately it's fairly short, too. Once the game opens up it's a good bit of fun if this is your type of game.

There are abilities and upgrades that flesh out the combat and feel of the game. You start out feeling very weak and awkward. Unfortunately all of these upgrades are gated behind beating the campaign; and so you are stuck doing the entire campaign feeling this way.

I would recommend playing the campaign on Normal or lower just to get through it, experience the story, and get into the fun part of the game. I completed it on Veteran and often felt like my time was being wasted.




Getting hit frequently by rank and file enemies that I was not even aware were attacking from my flank. If it weren't for visual indicators I'd have no idea what is going on.


This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it's a staple in horde shooters, but when there is no action in between arenas it becomes tedious and boring.


The option of dynamic enemy spawns is not an easy thing to do, but having dynamic rank and file spawns on top of the fixed spawn locations would definitely help with replayability.


Most of them not only sound identical in that the heavier weapons do not have a chunky audio queue compared to the mid range weapons, but a lot of them feel almost identical in function.


Largely due to other issues mentioned in this review, such as poor AI and a lack of audio queues.




Get a disconnect error. Switch to offline mode via the option given. Now playing in offline mode, but somehow get another disconnect error that resets me to a checkpoint again, huh?

Some of them are pretty big, such as not being able to queue Operations single player.

that have oppressive accuracy, engage from Narnia, yet are bullet sponges. This would not be as big an issue if there were 3 ranged weapon slots. With only 2 ranged weapon slots you are sort of pigeon holed into choosing a long range weapon and suffering the majority of close range enemies, or vice versa.


Most noticeable in objectives where you have to clear enemies off of a stationary target before they destroy it; I don't know if they're just not coded to target those enemies or if they're coded to prioritize rank and file enemies first, but they do not help at all.

Loading screen that shows up when Quit is selected freezes and the game just stops any functions.

if you don't care about crossplay. This is a minor pet peeve on a personal level, I do not like third party software included with my games, and I am especially not a fan of Epic Games.

Recent games almost all have the option to opt out of data collection in the menus. This should exist in every game. If you can't be transparent with exactly what you're collecting from me I do not want you getting anything from me.",Recommended,2671,38.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

templar-tony,https://steamcommunity.com/id/templar-tony/,"Most over hyped game of 2024

If you are coming into this with it being some revolutionary gaming experience you are going to be disappointed, its just a very solid, fun and extremely stylish 3rd person shooter-hack and slash hybrid.

But

BUT

If you are fan of Space Marine (2011) or a 40k fan in general this is the definitive 40k action game. Story campaign about 10hrs (singleplayer/co-op), six co-op ""Operation"" mode Left 4 Dead style missions that tie into the campaign and old school PVP with three maps and three modes. It improves upon Space Marine (2011) in every single aspect; graphics, cinematic style, art design, level design, environmental variety, size and scope, gameplay, DLC plan. I think there's good amount of content here for people to enjoy at launch now and if the developers stick to their 1 year plan it will be even better in a years time. I've been a 40k enjoyer, reader, miniature collector for over 20 years so this was a real treat. The developers clearly love the setting.

Gameplay:
Similar to the first game, some melee weapons have the same movesets with the addition of parry and dodge mechanics to help you control the mob better. You'll still be rolling around a lot like the first game but now whenever you get a perfect parry or perfect dodge you also trigger and auto-aimed headshot called a Gun Strike. Very satisfying. Health and armour were tweaked so you heal with health kits or special abilities and armour is now restored on executions, you are also immune to damage while performing executions. It takes a little bit of getting use to but once you get a hang of it its awesome fun and the change to executions mean you get to relish in the gratuitously bloody spectate. Only issue is that a lot of the bolter type weapons feel a bit weak. I find myself using the Meltgun at every possible opportunity as enemies are almost always right in your face.

Favourite thing:
The Space Marine customiser is so good they could sell it as a standalone product with all the colours and decals unrestricted and 40k hobbyists would buy it. It is very under-cooked on the Chaos side however, with specific legions for each class which is a little annoying, colour schemes not saving and no option to change armours.

Performance:
Had only 1 crash during my play-through of the campaign. Runs great with no hitching, stuttering, frame dips(only once) though I have found my CPU runs a bit on the hotter side. Others with 13th and 14th gen intel CPUs also reported the gaming running a bit hot.

My PC:
Intel i7-14700KF 3.40 GHz
32.0 GB
Installed on SSD
Nvidia GTX 4070 TI SUPER

I locked my framerate at 90 as it generally floated at about 88-110fps at 2k Resolution and everything on ULTRA. Only had a single instance of an FPS dip where it was 40 FPS in the campaign where you first fight the chaos marines. Apart from that it ran very smoothly. The engine is some seriously impressive tech to render so many enemies on screen with such massive environments at such high graphic quality, really impressive.

Needs improvement:
Some areas need some improvement though, I won't both mentioning as they are already listed as incoming as part of the Year One plan like more maps for both PVP and PVE. Balance between assault and ranged combat in PVP needs some refinement, very heavily titled toward shooty classes currently. Perk trees for PVE aren't that interesting.

Things I don't like (mixed):
Day 1 DLC plus some customisation content pay walled. Given that all the new maps & modes will be free I see this as a good trade off. You had to pay for both more PVP and cosmetic content in Space Marine (2011). Thankfully no in-game cash shop.

Things I missed:
Mark Strong as Captain Titus. Clive Standen gives a great performance, a classic gravely voiced marine, but there was always something about Strong's understated performance that made it really memorable. Probably because it made for such a refreshing take on a Space Marine character after the bombastic voice performances of the Dawn of War games.
Great performances all round from the whole cast though.

Its also not a Helldivers 2 killer, its nothing like Helldivers 2 except in the respect that you shoot aliens. Once Arrowhead fix there damn game I'll go back to playing Helldivers 2 as well as Space Marine 2.",Recommended,3585,48.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

Story,
The story is relatively short, but as far as I'm concerned it does exactly what It needed, and is a blast visually and audibly, even when there were things happening that I didn't understand from lack of context it was still fun and interesting enough to keep my attention and push forward, 8/10

Combat,
This is both awful and amazing, on the good side it feels, sounds, and looks great, but the actual motion of going through combat isn't good at all, the main problem is that there is no reliable way to heal, so lets break it down, the only ways to heal are. Stims, Retaliation, and being revived. So what's wrong with this? Well there aren't enough stims to keep you alive and going, nor does the Bloodborne inspired mechanic of retaliation work when there are multiple mobs all hitting you thus stopping any gain back you might get, Well what about just resetting with a revive? That doesn't work either because after getting knocked twice you will permanently die in the campaign, or you re-spawn after 1 minute in COOP.

Now all that doesn't seem so bad, but it leads to frustration all around, you will die, a lot, all the time, and it will feel cheap, because as you move through the maps you will get damaged, and eventually (especially on harder difficulties) you'll die, and you'll keep dying because there is no way to fully heal after or during encounters, so no matter what you will get chipped down and die, now I know people would say well that's what the armor mechanic is for, but that at best let's you brush off 3 hits, while this helps, and lets you maintain yourself in combat it's just not enough to keep you up and going.

I would like to mention this is primarily a campaign problem, then it lessens in COOP due to perks you can get with certain classes and is probably non existent in PVP.

In total 5/10, and if we get some kind of alternative way to heal later on as they patch and maintain the game I'd give it a 9/10.

I'm gonna end it there, in total I'd say this is a easy recommend if you like this kind of game, overall I'd say it's worth it just for the story and a fun campaign at lower difficulties.",Recommended,1896,22.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

If you are a 40k fan, it's one of the most outrageously faithful adaptations of the franchise into videogame form... if not THE most. It's not without some notable flaws that sour the experience, though.

While it's filled with incredible spectacle, surprisingly engaging story moments, and punchy gunplay, I feel like the health system from the first game was flat-out superior. In fact, I'd say it's almost the opposite of what it should be. There's no way to regain health in or outside of combat without the use of stims, and that's a complete inversion of the first game in a way that feels obnoxious. Your AI teammates are also frequently useless, and it will become a problem at a few key points in the campaign. Not enough to send you to reload a save, but enough to be annoying. This is absolutely mitigated if you play the campaign with friends, but if you don't, the experience can be undermined by the combination of the health system and the AI.

Space Marine 2 also requires a beefy CPU to play on PC if you are looking for consistently smooth framerates. I have a 7800x3D and had minimal issues, but be warned and use the refund policy if the game doesn't meet your performance standards on the hardware you are using.

ThorleyFO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThorleyFO/,"The stuff you need to know:

Gameplay is fun, visuals are nice. That's about it. The music is not even that memorable.

The campaign has a mediocre narrative, if you look past the fanservice. Very forgettable. I am struggling to remember anything that happened between the first mission and the last mission. I remember almost none of the dialogue.

Adjusted for time-flation, Dawn of War 1 had better customization.

Co-op is fun, if you're playing with friends. But, all the Co-op missions undermine whatever you customize your Astartes to look like, since all the voice lines are Ultramarine-specific.

Only 3 PvP maps on launch is honestly pretty awful.

100 dollary-doos is not worth it for what you actually get out of it, unless you like Ultramarines.

The game is, as of right now, September 13, not very well optimized. I don't care what CPU you have, it will bottleneck the S H I T out of this game. And there are practically no settings you can adjust to alleviate this.

The gameplay makes up for most of that, though.

Overall, it's not bad, for 40k fans. People who aren't 40k fans will find little to enjoy apart from the gameplay.

If not, this game is a mishmash of the Batman Arkham games melee combat on three buttons instead of four, and Halo-ish shooter. You have a very involved good story mode (which can be played co-op, and its about 9 or 10 hours long), a co-op mode that currently has 6 missions but is due to get more where you pick one of 6 classes and play through missions similar to the campaign in production value, and a PvP mode with 3 match types.

The PvP mode feels good, but only has a small number of maps that tend to feel samey. You have the same 6 classes as the co-op mode, but they lock most of the options for each class behind progression. Nothing really like it out there.

If you are a fan of 40k there are so many moments, and things faithfully brought to life. From the surroundings and architecture, to vehicles, to soldiers. Guardsmen salute with the aquila or kneel when you come nearby. There are scenes with commissars executing deserters, tech priests working on projects, so much attention has been spent on little details. Your exhaust ports in your backpack actually blow exhaust.

Additionally the game is a great introduction to the Warhammer 40,000 universe for new comers, and perfectly encapsulates the setting with fantastic environments, skyboxes, character models, enemies, guns. In addition it does a great job of setting the tone of the universe with the grim dark aspect being harshly played out as you look upon the futile struggle of humanity. The campaign is a great story with well written characters and fun well designed missions and co-op. The PVE multiplayer is incredibly fun and feels like it will never get old, the progression and cosmetic systems are truly what we should expect from a AAA game in this day and age and are almost entirely unlockable without additional purchases (DLC will include large cosmetic bundles). PVP is fun and surprisingly balanced (there are some clearly better options/classes but every class is viable) its cosmetic system is compatible with the PVE one meaning cosmetics can be unlocked once and be used in both modes.

September 5th.
Literally cannot get past the first Pre-rendered cutscene as the game stops responding and the audio continues in the background.
The game takes several minutes just to launch and get to the title screen.
Very disappointed as I bought the ultra edition and wanted to play early.
Checked for driver updates but were already up to date.
Verified the game files yet nothing changed.
I'll enable comments so If anyone knows how to skip the pre-rendered cutscene, please leave a comment on this review if you can.
I recommend anyone wanting to play to wait for either a patch or wait till the official release.

Update: after nearly three whole hours, I have still made no progress.
I tried many things other users recommended on discussions and nothing has improved.
I have tried:
- Making sure graphics drives are up to date (they are).
- Update Windows (Windows is up to date, Version 22H2).
- Verifying file integrity did nothing.
- Restart PC (did it but nothing new happened).
- Set graphics settings to low (had my graphics set to literal potato mode and still nothing better other than the game not responding for changing graphics to low).
- Disable Steam Overlay (No change).
- Go into Windowed mode (No noticeable change).
The furthest I have gotten in the game is a half black and half grey screen with the game saying I'm being connected to the server but nothing happens and the screen goes back to black.

September 6th
Update 2: Switched the games stored location to my other SSD and it has finally worked.
only took 12 hours to figure out.
Update 2.5: After finally playing the game and experiencing space marine 2 after that god awful bugged cutscene. It is a great game and I was getting a stable 53-60 frames at 1440p with little to no drops in frames. My CPU still nearly gets cooked alive while playing but I'm sure that will be sorted out.

Молодцы ребята!

У меня прохождение сюжетки заняло где-то часов 7? не соврать бы.

Вообще еле смог выйти из игры, я в прямом смысле просидел в игре почти всю субботу, Допрошёл сюжетку, и сразу с головой ушёл в пве.
Скатал пару каток в пвп, чувствуется вайб pvp в дестени, оно вроде есть, но ничего такого прям, чисто поубивать других. Будет круто, если потом завезут косметики которые можно будет открыть только в пвп, чтобы было больше стимула играть в него.


Играю на максимальных настройках, фпс в лютых замесах и на больших локациях, ну дропается максимум до 70-90, причём глаз разницы между 140+ и дропов до 90 мой не видит например (при монике в 144гц), только в цифрах такая разница, в остальном стабильные 120-144+

Ryzen 7 5800
4070 (12gb vram)
32gb ram

По поводу темпы бубнёж тоже не понял, у меня максимум до 60 градусов грелась видюха и проц. Про плачи с ультравайд мониками отдельная история, смешно с них, так как разрабы предупреждали, что поддержка будет позже, чо ныть то.

Не встретил ни одного бага, ничего не лагает, не фризит, все видео,кат сцены, синематики - всё плавно и чётко. за последнее вообще отдельный респект, графон потрясающий в синематиках очень)

Vascor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vascor/,"Like others have said, the game is pretty good!

The campaign took me around 15 hours to complete but that was due to exploring everything and taking over 250 screenshots... The environments are awesome, if you're at all familiar with the novels then this will bring great inspiration when you imagine scenes while reading the books. Played on the ""recommended"" difficulty and had no problems at all. Once you get used to the parry timing you're pretty much unkillable.

Operations exist, side objectives that tie into the main campaign where you will most likely be grinding the achievements.
only 6 missions, nothing special about them other than you get to select your classes.

I attempted to play Eternal War for like an hour and it just kept disconnecting me. I read online that you HAVE TO DISABLE CROSSPLAY to play the mode. after disabling it I loaded into a match in 2 seconds! The gamemode is... well... Same PVP what we got in the last game! You have to unlock weapons and skins like last time aswell so it will take a while...
It isn't anything special.
AND NO WARP DAMNED CHAOS CUSTOMIZATION YET. For love of that is Feth I hope they add more of that because I would love for my raptors/bulwarks/whatever to not look like an Alpha Legionary, Iron Warrior or Night Lord but with different colours. It looks dumb.

Would love to see older armor variants for BOTH SIDES. It'd be awesome to actually get the remastered MK6 armour that the HH minis have.

New classes would be awesome too, Librarians and apothecaries for example, maybe even a terminator! Would fething KILL to play as a Cataphractii Terminator (With full customization options)

New weapons! Chain/power axes, LIGHTING CLAWS!

Solo mode for PVE would be awesome. Would be even better if we got the camera mode in solo so we can take screenshots of our custom marines in action. Possibly even play as Chaos characters...

other than that I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale unless you reeeeally wanna try it out but then again if you do you would have bought it already. replayability is really low since it's just PVE with 6 same missions and then PVP. If you enjoy seeing the same environments over and over and over and over again you won't get bored.

Overall it was a 7.3/10 experience. Really hated the 4 days ""early access"" for extra money including the Twitch drop FOMO bs. Hopefully they won't go further down that route otherwise this review will go negative in a heartbeat.

Oh I almost forgot!

saithade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/saithade/,"Excellent game. Combat is satisfying and has a good reward for experienced use of skills, consumables, and abilities. AI Director makes the flow of PvE variable and challenging throughout. Painting my marine is exceptionally fun.

Campaign is extremely cinematic and a superb love letter to 40K fans. Some liberties were taken for Space Marines to tell a better a story and I accept this fully. Incredible ride.

Cons: My friends hear different voice lines for chatter in PVE mode than I do, all players should just hear the same thing.

I can't change the colour of class specific parts of armor (bulwark cloth anyone) very annoying.

Matchmaking needs more control and agency. I should be able to choose if I want bots, what classes they play, and if I want to make a lobby private / able to hotjoin more easily.

Only 6 levels in PvE mode, but this is very minor.

Had 2 bugged and unkillable [REDACTED] units which made levels much more difficult. However, 2 times over the course of 35 hours (minus the story time) is not bad.

Zeph285,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zeph285/,"So far I've played through the campaign. Gotta say it's exactly what I expected. while I've run into some server issues, the early access has run smooth barring one crash during a loading screen late in the chapter. If you're looking for a BLOODY good time, go ahead and pick it up. Between the consumer friendly monetization, and highly polished gameplay, I would highly recommend picking it up! I think if Saber keeps it up, they'll have a smashing success.

I'm not the type to praise a game for it's IP that it's spawned from, but it does the source material plenty of favors.

76561198079466603,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079466603/,"Just beat the campaign a few hours ago, waiting on my friends to do Operations (PVE), and potentially Eternal War (PVP) later on. The game is fun, while i haven't played SM1, I have seen it and it looks similar enough to where I can say... it's just SM1 with extra spice. The executions are well done, the combat is satisfying, and the gun play is fun. You can die incredibly quickly like a Space Marine would if you don't take enemies seriously; but if you fight properly you feel absolutely unstoppable.

The grand scale of the set pieces and the masses of enemies are awesome. If you're here just for the story, The Single Player is about 7-9 hours, and the PVE Co-Op mode has only 6 missions; If I say each is one hour that leaves you with about... 14 hours of gameplay that isn't PVP; this ignoring the multitude of classes, I believe 6, and the different difficulty levels and weapon loadouts; not to mention the awesome armor customization.


If you're here JUST for single player, I can't recommend it. It's awesome, the story is fun; but for 60 dollars the 8 hour story isn't very long. If you're here for the multiplayer, you'll get your moneys worth.

Also, a final bit; the cinematics are awesome, especially at the end. This game has some of the best cinematic shots and gameplay at the end; at least when it comes to 40k games.",Recommended,1100,27.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

Campaign is still super fun to play, beat the campaign and all the operations.

ILoveCostcoPizza,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILoveCostcoPizza/,"The environment, cinematics, and graphics are top notch, probably one of the best in 2024 BUT the game-play is.... OK. I had fun with the game but it did take me awhile to get used to the controls. I had to rebind some of my buttons for my keyboard and get the timing down on some of the parries and dodging. The visual indicators for parries and dodging is kind of useless when in a swarm, I instead listened to the sound indicators to get the timing down. I was playing on veteran difficulty and got frustrated a little because I felt like I was fighting the controls more then enemies themselves but I eventually got the hang of it. When I finally got the timing down with the parries and dodges, the campaign was almost over. Which is another thing that is frustrating, the campaign is short. Also, your AI bots are useless, they are just their to revive and that's it. I feel like the developers knew this would be frustrating with the controls and bots, so they added a lot of check-points.

I'm kind of biased and love everything Warhammer, both fantasy and 40K. So I already made up my mind that I was going to buy this game. I don't regret it, most of the cons I pointed out earlier are with the controls. It does feel like your an unstoppable tank on two legs when playing this game. Some times I just stop and look around at the level design just to admire it. If you played Starcraft and wondered how it feels to be swarmed by Zerglings in a first person view, this game demonstrates that.

Anyway melee has some sort of input delay, you can hardly animation cancel, every single strike feels like u aged 50 years as a cultist high on Slaanesh's manthighs and take seconds to respond. Parry works when it feels like it, lore-breakingly weak weapons + bullet sponge galore everywhere else.

This is the first time I've pre ordered a game, since gears of war 3 back in 2011, due to the way games now a days release unfinished and not fully tested, this game is my introduction to the series and this is a horrible image for the game itself.

The fact that there isn't even a patch out yet for all the people who pre ordered that are having issues is pretty bad as well, considering the game has been available for something like 6 hours now too.

Edit Sept 5th : After loading the game 4 times over the course of 2 hours, it finally began to run, with the exception of cutscenes. Cutscenes freeze/ or are at 1FPS. My game settings were set at high to medium and I even lowered them to no effect. This is a bad release thru and thru and thats a sad thing to say considering the gameplay is so badass.

2nd edit Sep 7th : Cutscenes still not functioning with no update for two days now. Beat the game and literally had to GUESS what was happening in the final cinematic thru listening to audio. Getting downright sad how little attention pre orders get.

3rd edit Sep 9th : No day 1 patch, no mention of everyones problems, ♥♥♥♥ the people who pre ordered I guess.

76561198016390861,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016390861/,"I am a big fan of W40K and SM1. Although I was initially Disappointed by the Controls and Console-Oriented gameplay, I am getting used to it, and it's Fun.

The campaign is great, with a good story and a lot of Epic scenes, but it's a COOP Campaign. If you do not have 2 friends to play with, stick to Normal Difficulty, and then you will enjoy it!

Gameplay: Well, it's very console-oriented. You can use the same button for Melee and shotting (while ADS). It's very annoying, but you can adapt if you love the game and Theme.
Parry is kinda of annoying to figure out but it seems you have to be out of animation for it to work properly and since devs empathes on big chunky clanky Space Marine there is a lot of momentum this makes Parry, and dodge tricky to properly time since your most of time swarmed by small enemies.

PVE COOP is great when you have 2 friends or get matched with 2 other competent players.
Ironicaly if you dont get matched with anyone and got stuck with 2 bots you can get through them much easier. But if you have 2 bad players or worst only 1 player and 1 bot. Then it's pretty much 0 win chance. Most of the time you will get Zerg by AI getting focused from Ranged and elites while swarmed by smaller enemies gives you no space for error.
PVE also has quite massive grind and this blocks you from challenging higher difficulties.
Differenc between green weapon and Purple is Massive. Stock weapon - LVL1, Green - LVL1, Purple - LVL2,3 this is how it seems right now.

Armor Customization/Paint job is awesome so many options styles etc. Class weapon limitations are insane and most classes are kinda unplayable cause of this but as you LVLup and get better weapons (well skins and stats) they will get very strong.


8/10 on the scale for me

I do like the game but if this was not W40K it would be like 6/10 or 6,5/10

Now I don't like that Space Marine takes so little to kill in this game like your Squishy to a ridiculous degree. Perks in PVE kinda of compensate but in Campaing its annoying and frustrating as you guns are Stock lowest tiers and this makes enemies very dmg spongy it brakes fantasy and it is just not fun so stick to Normal Diff on Campain to enjoy it.",Recommended,1800,107.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

For me, I run an i7, 32 Gigs of RAM, and a 4060 Ti and I can run the game mostly at Ultra, but it all sits at an idled 60%-90% GPU and CPU usage at all times. Hopefully, as the games support continues this will get smoothed out as it's a total banger of a game.

Only thoughts for the future? Give the Bulwark the damned Honor Guard Cape. Not the little one that sits attached to the back, the actual one they have in-game that goes over the shoulders. It's literally my only current grip. Because it's in-game currently, it's not a piece of gear they need to add later or design up. It's right there but seemingly unusable.

Operations? This is worth your time, if you're willing to learn the combat (i.e. research YouTube vids, e.g. pay attention to current idiosyncrasy with Bulwark parry compared to any other class). The combat is very difficult and messy, but satisfying enough to persist with given you are able to level up a character and select perks/abilities. Expect frustrations given the game doesn't sufficiently explain combat mechanics, but expect you to know them.

+ Runs smooth, looks good
+ Nice finishers
+ Satisfying combat (when you learn it and aren’t stun locked)
+ Lots of weapon and playstyle choice


Campaign downsides:
- Day 1 access via dlc only
- many weapons do not sound punch enough (e.g. can barely hear the iconic chainsword)
- inconsistent and messy combat feel
- When pushed up against a wall, camera gets incredibly close to player character obscuring the bulk of the view
- Cannot change FOV without a mod
- Sometimes too much on screen obscuring actual gameplay
- Extended stun-lock taking control away from the player
- Slow movement and an inability to make distance or take cover means you’re just tanking shields/health
- Campaign plot that’s hard to care about
- Elevators, elevators and more elevators (in the campaign)
- Don't confuse a ton of effects with good gameplay / cinematics

The combat is meatier than ever, with exciting executions, fountains of blood and guts and a design that is much more fluid than at first I gave it credit for. Combat has an excellent flow to it as you time your strikes, plan your combos and execute them with brutal effectiveness. The boss fights are genuinely challenging even at lower difficulties, and never felt boring to me. Using your dodge ability as well becomes crucial during at lot of these kinds of fights, using it to effectively counter AoE effects.

The enemy variety is good, could be better perhaps, but I wouldn't say it's anything really worth complaining about. Would I have liked to see more than mostly 'gaunts and Warriors for most of the playthrough? Yes. Did I ever get bored of fighting 'gaunts or warriors? No.

Venturing into spoiler territory a tiny bit, it's very refreshing to see the Chaos villain here being neither Khorne nor Nurgle. Both of these particular godly factions are a little overrepresented in Warhammer games, so to see the Chaos faction include neither was refreshing, and allowed for the Marine on Marine combat to feel different than otherwise might be expected.

Lastly, the voice acting was top notch. I was afraid when I heard that Mark Strong wouldn't be coming back and instead he'd be replaced by Clive Standen, who was pretty good in Vikings, but in the first few trailers I thought his voice sounded well... bad. I thought it sounded far to much like a man trying to an epic voice instead of just naturally having one. Pleased to say I was very, very wrong. Clive Standen is fantastic as Titus, and the rest of the cast are top notch as well.

If I had to give a complaint? Tzaangors are ♥♥♥♥♥♥' annoying and I hate them, and the pylon mission was (at the time) infuriating, but that's a 10 minute segment of a 8+ hour campaign so I forgive them. Your AI companions aren't great, and especially felt useless there, but they do do SOME of the killing work, and often make for excellent fodder to take enemy attention away from you.

I played on Normal difficulty initially and felt challenged enough, but I could probably go higher in my next playthrough. Playing with friends in campaign I would definite up the difficulty to compensate, as 3 competent players would eviscerate.

All in all: Buy this game if you like Warhammer 40k. Buy this game if you like good action campaigns and fun multiplayer. Buy this game on sale if you like good campaigns and multiplayer is hit or miss for you. There is PvE MP too so take that into consideration.",Recommended,2286,15.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

You can quit the game during a mission and pick up where you left off next time because these missions are LONG so each checkpoint really feels like a checkpoint and not just a ""place you go back to when you die""

Little detail I wish every game had: You can carry three frag grenades max, and grenade pickups always have three grenades in them for a full resupply. If you have one grenade left and attempt to resupply, it will take two grenades from the box and leave one lying on the ground for someone else. Wasting/deleting grenades by picking up a resupply too soon is not possible!

As a fan of WH40k and first game I was really skeptical since the first time I've read Sabre interactive is going to make a sequel and considering their portfolio rightfully so. Well luckily I was wrong and this might be the cleanest launch of 2024 yet, no I did not play coop or pvp yet because it only makes sense to go throught the game solo first to explore it in detail and only after that have fun with others.

So far Space Marine 2 has been buttery smooth experience with no performance spikes, no bugs so far or at least none that I would notice (ok once during boss fight bots were stuck on fighting instead of reviving). What I would be happy if they added subtitles for dataslates, maybe some bestiary or some lore info for WH40k newcomers but those are really just minor QoL things.

It clearly looks like the campaign was balanced for 3 ppl coop but so far it has been easily playable with bots even though they sure aren't the sharpest pencils in the cup. Pretty much happy with characters, story, sound design and the overall presentation, there are some stunning vistas and opulent setpieces just as they should be.

At first I thought to myself it'd have a single player campaign, then a PVE co-op mode that was just 6 levels, and the PVP mode.

What I didn't realize, is that the entire campaign can be played in Co-Op as well, with the only downside being that you can't pick a class and you don't get the multiplayer progression.

The gameplay itself is incredibly tight. What you do in single player is what you do in multiplayer with the only restriction you get from the class system being the weapons you can bring with you to the map and what ability you have.

Its so good I'm not even mad it needs to run epic in the background for the multiplayer to function. It completely dunks on both Darktide and Helldivers 2.

WhynotGerrit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhynotGerrit/,"Everything runs great. The first mission is definitely an eye opener when it comes to Tyranid Swarms and as an avid Guard & Bug player I love it. I started the game on the intended difficulty (Hard, compared to Easy, Normal, and Very Hard). After 3-4 missions I toned it down to Normal because Hard started to ruin the fun with how often I was going down and how tense combat was becoming (which is great when you're used to the controls, not when you're still learning).

For a first play through I think Normal is a good sweet spot of difficulty where you'll still go down if you're not being careful. It's not as nerve wracking as Hard where I came out the other end of a mission drained, not looking forward to continuing, rather than getting to enjoy the experience and atmosphere of WH40K.

I've been playing on Mouse & Keyboard and can easily see how playing on a controller would make combat much easier.",Recommended,748,10.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

76561198064317632,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064317632/,"Before I get into this, i just wanna preference that if you enjoyed the first game, you will without a doubt, love this as its an upgrade on basically every front. AND that this is an Early Access, so it is expected to have many bugs, this is what they are designed for so they can detect these bugs and potentially fix them before the full game is shipped off, i feel that some people dont understand that so i feel the need to state it.

-----------------------------------------THE GOOD-----------------------------------------
As far as 40k games go, this is by far, the most faithful to the universe. its story, the combat, the environment, all fantastic and about as faithful as any current 40k game is going to get. The story, whilst it is short, which isn't a bad thing in the slightest, is fantastic, every moment feels like you're in a cinematic even when you're not, and when you are in one, they're some of the best cinematics I have seen as of late, you really get to know the characters and see them develop through-out. You may also see some people talk about how you need to know the lore of 40K to understand the story, however this is not the case, as many of the thing are explained to you, and anything that you maybe think you need a little bit more clarity on are just a quick search away and i can confirm this due to many people i know who are not into warhammer as much as I am found it perfectly fine to understand.(as a side note, as much as i love to play on the hardest difficulty on a lot of games, i whole heartedly recommend u play it on normal or veteran until the AI gets fixed, or you find some friends to play with, because some of the later moments seem almost impossible to do, even after trying multiple different strategies multiple times)

The combat feels so fluid and blends together beautifully between each shot and strike and the sound design of the guns in this game, they make every gun feel weighty and powerful, something that i found was lacking in Space marine 1, which i can set aside since the game is 13 years old now, at times it may feel like u should've parried an attack or dodged it, however the indicators for such attacks can be a bit questionable, some of the attacks will come to you really quickly, whereas other will be much slower. only advice i can give is to parry or dodge when the attack actually hits you and not when you see the indicator

The environments..they are, absolutely amazing, as someone who is heavily into environments, these scenes that saber interactive have produced are just breathtaking. Other than darktide, you are not going to see the grand scale of the 40k universe, and i'd even go on to say you would have trouble grasping it in darktide, with SM2, you can see the absolute scale of these scenes, from the vast jungles, to the sprawling hive cities, they've truly captured the beauty within 40k

-----------------------------------------THE BAD-----------------------------------------
I think it goes without saying, no matter what the game is, its going to have some bad sides to it, literally no game is perfect, its impossible to please everyone and its not a bad thing to say that, but some of SM2's issues are issues for everyone and i believe they should be addressed.

The FPS, now this is a huge issue for some people, especially those on weaker machines, but the FPS in SM2 is bad, especially when the swarms upon swarms of tyranids begin to rush your location, i will easily drop to 20-30 fps in times like this, thankfully however i can deal with it, however some people I know will not be able to and it might ruin the experience for them, and if this is the case, i highly recommend waiting until it is fixed, speaking of which, i believe that the devs are aware of this issue and are working on a patch for some time in the future, hopefully the day 1 patch.

The AI. my god the AI is as dumb as a ton of bricks, aside from reviving you when you go down or using their abilities, they are in all essence useless at anything else, they cant kill or anything, which is a very big part of this game obviously and it feels like you do all of the heavy lifting, which is why i recommend that you do no play on angels of death difficulty for the moment until they hopefully get an upgrade because as stated, it is almost impossible in some sections.

Now, in terms of the PVP, I have yet to properly play it, but from what I've heard it is a great experience, I do however have 1 issue with it, that being that the traitor astartes get far far far less customisation options when compared to their loyalist cousins, Now i do understand the reasoning for this, they have very little ways in which they can be changed, but it would've been nice to be able to change the design of the helmets and pauldrons and even the chest pieces, because in alot of artistic renditions, they very clearly have different designs that could've been used, especially the death guard, they have so many designs to pick from, yet we're stuck with the basic death guard who shows very little signs of corruption from papa nurgle. It would also allow us to play as the thousand sons, as they are absent from the choices due to being purely psykers/librarians which is not a playable class, atleast for the time being.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a parting note, if you're an avid 40k fan who wants to see the universe represented in a faithful way, this is definitely the game for you, it has everything you could want out of the game and more on the way.

Although this may have been intentional given your playing an Ultramarine in a combat suit, it deffinetly needs more work. I'm not a fan of the dodge/parry system, its too simplistic and does not feel satisfying i.e enemy attack blue = parry, red = dodge. Other than that the graphics and visuals are insanely good, the story starts off slow but as the game progresses it gets better and better. Its almost too unrelenting, I feel the story needed more down time between missions to flesh out characters and the story, instead it jumps from mission to mission with barely time to breathe. The campaign took me about 10 hours to finish, they could have fleshed this out another 5 hours with more downtime, dialogue and cutscenes to start unravelling the story and fleshing out the characters and their own back stories.",Recommended,735,14.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

The game runs fine, No Epic games launcher was not installed. It just downloads some stuff so there is crossplay between Epic and because this game runs on the Epic Games back-end. And guess what? The servers are stable and work fine from day one. But because people SEE Epic Games they got unreasoable for whatever reason. I don't know why....we get an online game with working servers and BOOM it's still a problem somehow.

I too wish there was Ultra-wide support from the start....there isn't. But the devs let us know beforehand, they also let is know they will be including it laters this month. This was communicated beforehand.

And then there is the people angry at them not being able to install right away. RESTART YOUR STEAM. THAT IS HOW IT HAS ALWAYS WORKED, IT'S NOT THE DEVS FAULT. THIS IS HOW STEAM WORKS.

morgorothquellovero,https://steamcommunity.com/id/morgorothquellovero/,"The game is great! If you're wondering why there are so many negative reviews, it's mainly for two reasons. First, the average Steam user seems to have some deep-rooted grudge against Epic Games (like they stole their candy as kids or something), and since this game requires Epic Games services to work online, they obviously downvoted it. The other like 5% of the negative reviews are because of the lack of ultrawide support (the devs already plan to add it, it's on the roadmap, just read it) and the 4 days early access for those who got the deluxe/gold/ultimate edition. Get over it.

Other than that, the game runs well if you have a decent PC, and it’s a ton of fun! Also, none of that modern audience garbage.",Recommended,591,2.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

76561198312767090,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198312767090/,"After finishing the campaign and co-op campaign, i can say this:

This is the definitive Space Marine game. There is no other game that evokes the feeling of being a Space Marine, genetically altered to be perfection and death incarnate, to be an Angel of the Emperor.

It's also so lore-accurate. Every enemy you encounter you can just look up and get genuine lore for. I have Death Watch Mark of the Xenos book, and every Tyranid I encountered has an entry in it (Although I do with that a trygon, tyrant guard, or prime warrior made an appearance. They'd make good bosses.)

The melee combat is so visceral, and it took me a bit to get used to using guns as an accessory to it. Once you get the practice, you can become an instrument of divine wrath, the Emperor's will manifest.

The final missions are also just peak warhammer. I won't say anything about those as I don't want to spoil it. But they're so grand and awesome, I yelled with joy (I'm not even exaggerating here) when I recognized some units.

I love this game. This was worth the money I spent to play it early. If you're looking for a good Warhammer game? This is it. IF you want a universal jumping off point for 40k? This is it. If you want to feel like a badass killing hostile aliens? This. Is. It.

For the Emperor!

jayceran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jayceran/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating return to the iconic action of the original, blending the intense power of a Space Marine with refined gameplay mechanics that modern gamers expect. Right from the start, Space Marine 2 grabs your attention with its stunning visuals, capturing the grimdark beauty of the Warhammer 40K universe with jaw-dropping environments and impressively detailed character models. The attention to lore is impeccable, allowing both die-hard 40K fans and newcomers to immerse themselves in the epic, galaxy-spanning conflict.

The combat system shines, offering visceral, weighty melee and ranged combat that feels empowering. The ability to seamlessly switch between weapons, chainswords, and bolters adds a satisfying rhythm to the combat flow, allowing for creative and brutal takedowns. The new additions to the arsenal give players even more destructive options, and the larger scale battles against swarms of enemies are adrenaline-pumping.

Character progression is also a standout, allowing players to feel the growth of their Space Marine as they unlock new abilities and gear. The narrative is engaging, pulling players into the ruthless world of the Imperium, where the stakes couldn't be higher, and no battle is fought without sacrifice.

What sets Space Marine 2 apart is its ability to balance large-scale battles with intimate, close-quarters combat. Whether you're taking down hordes of Tyranids or engaging in epic one-on-one duels, the game delivers a perfect blend of chaos and strategy.

Overall, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 successfully builds on its predecessor while injecting enough innovation and polish to feel fresh. It's a must-play for Warhammer 40K fans and action game enthusiasts alike, offering a brutal, thrilling ride through the grimdark future.",Recommended,1556,3.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

Yes, you will see colorful locations, attention to detail, brutal scenes, but you will not leave a feeling like something is missing. The company is very short, and there are only 6 side quests with other players.

The developers want to overshadow the repetitiveness by giving us different classes and character upgrades, however, it does not cancel the lack of variety. Combat system is also not for everyone. Can't remember any soundtrack from the game, just a boring ambient.

About PvP I'm not talking at all - it feels very, very clumsy.

In the end I can say that this game is a risky investment in the future. If the developers don't abandon the project as it was in the case of Darktide developers, it might be a wonderful game.",Recommended,825,40.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

The online PvE and PvP systems are really good; different classes create team synergies that work really well and make you feel like you have a specific role to play within the squad.

There are some issues - matchmaking can take a while, and loading takes ages but it's worth it for the visuals. Bot squad mates are actually morons, they have near infinite health but rarely attack anything and have no appreciation for the many 'protect X' objectives - this is only really a problem if you're playing campaign on veteran or higher.

My main gripe is that you can only have one of each class per 3-man squad, but the matchmaking will throw you in with random people so you end up not being able to start a game because 2 or more people are the same class. This happens half the time, meaning one of you has to change class or leave. This is really annoying when you're on high level operations and only have one class levelled up enough to be able to take it on.

All that aside, it's a solid game. Expect a challenge that rewards you.",Recommended,1002,34.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

I see a lot of complaints about the length of the storymode but keep in mind this is a live service game with more story content (in the form of operations) are coming in the future!

Overall I would give the game a solid 8.5-9/10

TLDR
-Graphics are beautiful, cutscenes even more so.

The combat is a bit challenging at first - there are several different abilities, but it feels great once you get used to everything, and unlock the jetpack. When fully equipped you can dash across the battlefield to engage specific enemies, or rip up into the sky before crashing down in a massive AOE attach. I'm 4 hours in and no where near the 1/2 way point, so take those reports of a short campaign with a grain of salt.

Graphics? More glorious than a Golden Throne selfie! The colors pop like a Chaos Space Marine at a paintball match.

Gameplay? Satisfying enough to make my Power Fist tingle! Nothing like smashing Tyranids into paste while shouting, ""FOR THE EMPEROR!"" to really get the blood pumping. (But seriously, I should probably tone down the yelling; the neighbors are starting to complain...)

Story? It’s about as deep as a puddle on a T'au world, but who cares? I’m here to turn Xenos into sludge and take names! I mean, let's be real: every plot twist just means more enemies to obliterate.

Multiplayer? Oh, the sweet joy of fragging my friends while they scream, ""STOP USING THAT POWER FIST!"" Sorry, bro! It’s the only way to ensure the Emperor's will is done.

Fun Factor? Off the charts! I laughed so hard my helmet nearly came off. I even tried to do the Space Marine walk in real life. Spoiler: I tripped over my cat.

Overall, if you want to experience the grim darkness of the far future with a side of hilarity and a dash of over-the-top violence, grab this game. Just remember: in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there is only war... and memes.

Pro Tip: Always carry a spare bolt gun. You never know when you'll need to shoot a heretic or your buddy during a heated debate about who’s the best Primarch.

PvE operations were fun until I got to ruthless difficulty. People have learned how OP Multi Meltas are and they just trivialise the game. It does way too much damage. It can kill hive tyrant in about 15seconds. It one shots trash mobs with deep penetration so it is incredible at clearing hordes of them. Perks allow you to sustain the ammo. For comparison I play Assault with the Thunder hammer. My light attacks take 3 hits to kill trash mobs in ruthless. You can use heavy attacks which do a lot more damage but unlike with the melta there is huge risk in how slow they are and the animation locks. In the time it takes to fully charge aftershock which does about 5-10% damage to hive tyrant when fully charged the multi melta gets it to half health. I dont even have to try anymore in most of my games im usually just running around executing majoris and trying to ground slam trash mobs before they get roasted. It has gotten really boring.

Got several more hours into this beast, a quick update;

The Good;

- Visuals are fantastic
- Lore is pretty much 100% spot on
- Runs buttery smooth on a half decent pc setup
- Co-op operations feels like this is where the heart of the game is. A lot more fun when you have a full squad of human folks with you.
- Thunder Hammer
- Boss fights are actually pretty fun, much improved over the weird QTE mess that they were back in SM1

The 'I'm still not too sure about this';

- Melee combat STILL feels off; clunky, slow, laggy and feels unresponsive more than half the time.
- Parrying is still wildly inconsistent and windows for them can be very tiny and next to impossible to execute if you're already in an attack chain or getting swarmed and stunlocked by gaunts.
- Bolters sound and feel the best they've ever been in a 40k game but ranged combat as a whole still feels weak and needs to get buffed.
- Even though playing with friends IS a better experience, that's honestly on your friends and not the game.
- The customization grind is very slow, and you get no exp for doing the campaign; operations and PVP only.

The Bad;

- Healing still feels wrong; in the OG you go into melee and rip & tear to get your health back with executions, in this one you get your health back via the Bloodborne rally system and armour via executions; issue is that you will be swamped 9/10 and what health you get back is instantly gone making. You HAVE to chain the pistol one tap gimmick to keep your armour up in the thick of it which gets tedious quickly.
- Ranged enemies still strip your armour and health super fast and with insane precision. Especially them venom cannon warriors.
- Zonethropes are TINY. WHY YOU SO SMALL???
- Ai team mates are useless in the campaign but weirdly more competent in the operations if you happen to have an empty slot.
- QTE enemies still feel like a cheap death.
- Solo play still feels miserable; a.i. will focus on you only and ignore your a.i. team mates. If you have other humans with you it does split the aggro which is really weird.

I feel if you got a good amount of 40k buddies this'll serve you well for a bit, but playing solo will most likely be a worse off experience.",Recommended,1843,17.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

314156907,https://steamcommunity.com/id/314156907/,"With no spoilers, my review of Space Marine 2's story is summed up as thus:

The perfect sequel to the first game.


It has some flaws currently, but all of these are outweighed by the gameplay and story.

Chief among them SO FAR:

-Co Op does not support private lobbies YET
-Co Op is limited to 3 players (If they double it or at least don't intervene in modding then this will make the game even more popular)
-Assorted nitpicks about particular weapons (IE certain heavy attacks not staggering enemies out of unblockable attacks is infuriating in some cases)
-Certain difficulty scaling elements feel excessive or fall more into the Frustrating camp than challenging camp
-Coop squads can only have one of any class, which while i understand is going to make more people unhappy than happy
- THAT MASSIVE TEASE in the main that left me with the most blue of ultra smurf balls!

But like I said, those are all nitpicks. Overall I give this game a 9/10 with a 10/10 for the story.


I was also EXTREMELY happy to see that GW's recent infestation by slaaneshi cultists has had effectively 0 impact on the game's story.",Recommended,932,62.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

Archmystic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Archmystic/,"Edit: after finishing the campaign and playing some more i still stand by my opinions, the visuals of the game and the story itself is very fitting for a space marine game though, and it has made me change it from a barely no to a definite yes.
difficulty and enemy HP still seems a problem and the AI could use a lot of work, but other than that it is a great game.

I wish there was a middle-ground option for yes/no.
Singleplayer seems just not meant to be, go play the 1st one instead
parrying/dodging feels like its meant to be in a co-op situation with other players, espc since enemy AI seems to prefer the player to your AI hologram ""helpers"".
and i don't like the armor recharge+healing system compared to the 1st ones self-healing offensive playstyle with executes.

the AI is more or less wet tissue controlled by a banana rotting.
The game also installs EOS very VISIBLY the first time you launch the game(but you can just delete/uninstall EOS completely with no sideeffects to online, it will keep asking you to verify files when u open up the game cuz its lacking, but online works fine with no hiccups, i hope they remove or atleast make it op-in later)

on the upside:
PvP is fast and TTK is super low which makes it fast and fun
Co-op feels like how both side missions and the main campaign is meant to be played, feels fun.
game looks amazing, sounds as you would expect, ranged guns feels great to use and shoot.",Recommended,1178,41.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

RCascade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RCascade/,"A game with awesome visuals that stays true to the lore of 40k. I only want to talk about the cons.

The veteran diffculty mode which is the default mode, is scaled for coop multiplayer. Doing it alone is doable but an annoying experience.

Was misled into thinking this was gonna be a casual shooting gallery but its a totally stressful experience on single player. A mission required me for example to use a flame thrower to drive away fodder enemies but there are tanky flying mobs that will shoot at you at the same time. Add to that there will be heavily armored mobs also attacking you. The AI in this barely do anything and so youre left having to multitask your ass off.

Some other proof that the difficulty is scaled for coop is that ranged mobs do sooo much damage and also very tanky. Clearly you need a teammate that has to focus those.

Thumbs down for now but I will keep playing at this difficulty because iam a total badass.


EDIT: I found out that the campaign is not very long and it does get easier later on in singleplayer. What I've said above don't feel like an issue anymore which is why i'm changing it to thumbs up. Also thumbs up because I also want them to make more 40k games like this in the future.

That being said I still believe there are some weird design choices that they've made with this game and something about it feels incomplete. Making this game is a step in the right direction but they need to do better.",Recommended,1187,30.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

- The history of the different chapters as well as that of the Ultramarines is very well respected. And the history of the game is full of small historical details which make us caught in this spiral of the story, which prolongs the immersion in this chaotic universe.

The only issue i currently have is it runs bad. like really really bad, on low settings with DLSS on ultra performance it struggles to latch onto 60 fps, in combat..? expect 40's-50's its somehow worse than darktide which is astonishing. If you have a 3 thousand dollar computer im sure it'll run fine but for most people who have average specs expect bad performance. I really cant imagine how bad the console version suffers with framerate.. Saber, fix the optimization please. (coop review) the music, combat and scenery all carry over, fantastic stuff. The replayability aspect and operations in general is where things get meh.. the wwz system saber had was flawless but instead of doing that they moved onto a less horde more small engagement stuff with marked enemy targets which i really dislike (missions are way too long as well) which was a MAJOR mistake. if you're looking for a fantastic 40k campaign with top notch everything you will absolutely find this to be beyond worthy of your 60$ i don't regret a cent. if you're in it solely for the coop content you may not really like it as its for a certain type of people. if you're expecting a wwz clone with great horde combat and replayability they completely changed the formula and you wont find that here. it feels like a tacked on mode as an afterthought. granted SM1 was a campaign first game as well so this is hardly surprising.",Recommended,1234,14.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

76561198068417239,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068417239/,"Pros:
Great Combat: Mix of God of War and Space Marine 1, balanced, fun and satisfying.
Immersive: You absolutely feel the power of being a Space Marine. Amazing Swarm Combat.
Beautiful Visuals: Every Chapter is beautifully done including Chaos Marines, Amazing and immersive atmospheres.
I love the customization variety and how it mimics collecting paints and decals on tabletop.
PVE Modes are amazing: If you have been looking for a Co-op game this is it.
PVP is generally fun Chaos Chapters are very well done but could use more customization.
I would say the one of the best if not the best 40k games ever made.

Cons:
Customization UI is very poor: Cant use Scroll Bar, Cant Delete custom slots.
Friendly ai is poor, but do their job well enough
PVP servers seem to be up and down: will most likely resolve upon release
PVP could use more variety: This may come with time?
Minor glitches/bugs

I think the in flight JumpPack slam prep animation looks little funny but it is still satisfying so its okay.

Voice acting is okay, should of done way more for pvp voices at least. Poor in comparison to DoW 1 & 2 and Space Marine 1 and even Rouge Trader. This could be up to personal preference though. It would be cool to select between voices for custom designs: i.e. Heretical, iconoclastic Dogmatic.

Lasyusha-Chan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lasyusha-Chan/,"Too many people complaining about ""No Ultra Wide Support"".

So heres my opinion.
Bro Ultra Wide Support isnt here yet, They told you this, You Monitor isnt common.

Lets talk about the actual problems.
Yes Controller support is a must for most people and not having support for something you have support for on Consoles is a little bit odd.

The Game itself runs well (Ish),
i7-9700k, 3070oc, 32GB DDR4 RAM, M.2 SSD. Mid - High Settings 55-65 fps.
3440x1440 monitor. (I'm not complaining about the widescreen support though)

Combat is smooth and is very akin to Eternal Crusades.

Swarm of enemies aren't as demanding as I thought and the slaughter feels amazing.

The Bad part is. and for some reason outside of people wining about their niche monitor's, The game has a crashing problem.

But outside of the crashes its a good game so far.",Recommended,708,10.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

Changes:
- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class
- fix the servers becasue it takes too long to load
- fix the ai of the bots
- make perks free on level up so we do not have to pay to unlock. It like in games like vermintide and dark tide.

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- add more customization options for all space marines in general
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.
- add a pvp mode with just bots so I can have fun fighting.",Recommended,1441,21.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 10

They managed to make the Warhammer: Space Marine sequel we've been dreaming of.

Everything from the first game is turned up to 11.

The atmosphere is fantastic and so authentic it makes you feel like you're playing Dawn of War but as one of the units on the ground in massive chaotic combat.

Story was about what you'd expect, nothing too groundbreaking but some nice surprise twists and badass moments.

Only experienced some minor visual bugs one or twice and network connectivity issues but by the time you read this they could already be patched.

Verdict:

If you're a fan of third-person action games this is a strong contender.

If you're a fan of Warhammer it's a must buy.

phertiker,https://steamcommunity.com/id/phertiker/,"I recommend this for the feeling of the universe of 40k and because so many other people are having fun. I deeply, deeply hate the combat 95% of the time.

This game nails the feeling of W40k and being a Space Marine. You feel heavy but can dodge around, the swings of a chainsword feel meaty, and the bolters are incredible. The environments are baroque and huge and, usually, covered in blood and ichor and on fire. Seriously, the world-building and general feel of the game is A+ 150%.
The sound effects and music are also A+. Maybe more than that... the voice acting is excellent, of course, but every weapon sounds perfect, the chunk of a door opening is perfect, etc. Love every second of it.

The jump pack could be the entire game and I would love it.

The graphics options are barebones. Needs more granularity, and even with upscaling disabled (probably? hard to tell the way the two AA and upscaling options are described) everything is vaguely fuzzy... which is too bad because the details are awesome, right down to the stamping on bolter shells, the wear and tear on a command console, the burning candle on a servo skulls head.

Anyway, I hate the combat. To be clear, this is a skill issue. I'm old and I've destroyed my brain (don't do drugs).
I hate quick time events, and I'm bad at them... and the combat in this game is all QTE's.
You dodge the red ones, you block the blue ones. But you also block the non-telegraphed attacks, and when you do that just right you can then click to fire and get some armor back. Then you click to swing your chainsword, and maybe start a combo, or maybe you get tagged by the 1000 fodder that are surrounding you, or maybe you randomly spin to hit them and the big guy hits you... and everything staggers you, so then you spend a bunch of time lurching uncontrollably around trying to hit the right button at the right time.

Basically, you spend every combat watching for a small crosshair icon on an individual Tyranid so you can click to fire and keep your armor up, and hopefully get them to the point where you can press E to execute. The rest of combat is listening for the chime of an unblockable attack. In big fights, the chiming is constant so my chances to actually attack are few and far between. There's a fight early on with a Ripper swarm and two Zoanthropes, and the chiming was so constant I literally couldn't left click or I'd be hit with something horrible.

I don't play Dark Souls for a reason... but having said that the fights I like most are the boss fights with big honking enemies... it's still just a QTE, but you don't have lethal distractions like fodder jumping on your back and somehow staggering you for 4 seconds.

The armor system seems neat at first, but it's just a layer over your health bar that recovers in chunks... and gets taken away so fast that I don't see the point. Does it prevent stagger? Doesn't seem like it, although I'm so bad at blocking that I probably just never have any armor nodes.

The first game was simple, sure, but straightforward and efficient. Shoot a bit until you're in range, then swing that chainsword, and execute for health restore. In this game, you can restore a bit of armor with the dumb stagger/gunshot thing, or a bit more with an execution.
But I'm too dumb to hit any of the buttons at the right time, so I just spend my time dodging and blocking and hoping the trash AI companions will actually shoot things if they aren't caught on a crate or door frame.

I switched to easy, but then combat is boring... and it's still just a big continuous QTE.

I'll play through every bit of content, of course, because the story is rad and the companion characters are fun, unlike that whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ Leandros from the first one. The Ultramarines are lame, but the developers are continuing the story and that's great.

There are bugs with overlapping dialog (on my system anyway), but otherwise I'll totally free of the challenges some other folks are having.",Recommended,3273,11.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

I never pre-order games anymore, but I pre-ordered this one and I wasn't disappointed.

TheMetaFace,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMetaFace/,"If anyone here was thinking about this game, honestly... I can recommend it, the campaign with some diverging and looking about, it is entirely linear, takes about 10 hours or so, with friends probably less, but there's operations and while right now there are only six of them the intent is to play them one at a time, bump the difficulty, and repeat over and over until you max out and there IS PvP which I won't touch because I hate that crap and some people claim there's a lot of hackers despite EAC being packed in, ultimately the campaign though is well enough made that it warrants some praise despite how short it is, the characters are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but killing bugs and heretics is what it really is about and other than a few issues that will probably be fixed upon actual release it was fairly satisfying and the short length probably does it a favor in preventing it from becoming stale, hope they do something to prevent that further. Some other things, the guns mostly feel all the same, there's some exceptions, but the very minor stat changes aren't enough to make most of them feel any different than the rest and most of them are pretty mediocre, ended sticking with the sniper or carbines as the other rifles are were kind rubbish, only three ""side arms"" which are actually your real weapons once you realize the ""primaries"" are kind of weak or niche. Performance was exactly as they claimed base on recommended specs which I ironically just happened to have a 5800x and 3070ti, changing the desired FPS to 90 and having DLSS set to dynamic meant I always had the minimum FPS I wanted and the only performance issue I had was stuttering related to loading in the second mission, apparently NVME SSDs aren't fast enough for this game. Needs some work with combat too, too often you go to parry an enemies attack, get hit from behind, and suddenly during the entire duration of the animation you take full damage because now the parry is considered void, now you are stun locked and probably will lose all your armor and 80% of your health before you can move again, this is at ""normal"" difficulty, definitely needs fixing.",Recommended,1760,23.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

The combat system is bad and more frustrating/harder than the enemies.
Verry clumsy, enemies will constantly stunlock, you get stuck so often in the animations.
Your notifiers of enemy attacks work only half the time, either your character doesn't act while pressing or youre stuck in an animation or even the enemy suddenly decides not to attack you.
The armor system it is mostly useless besides acting like an extension of the health bar.

Some tips for new players

- This is a team game without co-ordination you will die yes you're strong but swarms can and will melt your health bar so don't rush in like cod and then disconnect because you died

- Stop hoarding loot especially if you're a melee class theirs no reason for you to take loot from the heavy such as Ammo the heavy cannot use a melee weapon so by taking the ammo from him you've effectively made him useless.

- Prep your gear before hand (tired of waiting 60 seconds to go to a mission because you decided to spent ages customising plus it saves time) so do it before hand or leave matchmaking to do it

- Executions give you armour so while cool they offer you that armour that could save you plus while doing so you cannot take damage so it's a win win

- only 1 class per mission so make sure none of your friends have the class you want eyed up

- Requisition is the currency used and can be used to upgrade and buy new cosmetics so ideally only buy 1 set as it can be a pain to grind and only 990 can be held so spend it before doing another mission

- This is 40K and for those unaware Space Marines have 3 hearts which has translated to 3 lives after which you will die and respawn so try to spend it wisely and move as a unit

- Servitors are found by looking around each mission and will offer you a skill point only one of you needs to activate it and you should all get a skill point

But most importantly have fun

76561198283898834,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283898834/,Great game campaign is unreal. Map design is crazy props to that. PVP needs a bit of work. Any class not designed around melee just sucks for melee. Space marines are hand to hand combat beasts but in this game unless you have a hammer everything else sucks. Landing a parry has no negative effect so you just have to spam dodge while hip firing. Improving the melee would lead to some cool pvp moments. The hit reg on melee is terrible as well. I have a 50 50 chance on the swing landing even though I see it go through his body. Over all the gameplay is super fun though,Recommended,462,22.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I bought the Ultra Edition since I really liked the first Space Marine game. All I received was the game taking upwards of 20 minutes to even load into to the MAIN MENU. When I start the campaign, the cut scene stutters and crashes. This was written AFTER the hotfix update. Which had gotten me a little farther in the cut scene just to crash again. No Ultrawide/widescreen support at launch is crazy considering even the sad excuse for Call of Duty that is MWIII 2023 has it. In summary, I didn't get to play my preorder early (most i've spent on a game EVER) and this only strengthens my opinion to not preorder games. Good Launches matter, Focus Entertainment.

That match gave me 100% completion, but the servers reset at the end of the match so I couldn't add them as friends.

However, the game is an Imperium's worth of oppression level of fun. The Operations are great, being able to customize your Marine to many of the chapters is wonderful, the models are great. The Marines FEEL thicc. I've had many games with folks who do some light RP, and I haven't RP'd in a game in a long time, but with this one I am.

If you don't know anything about the Warhammer 40,000 Universe, it isn't required to play this game. You can still hop in and have fun in campaign mode, operations mode, or pvp mode. (Though, if you're interested, look at reading Horus Rising, the first novel of the Horus Heresy which kicks all of this off in the 30th millennium, before the Imperium of today became what it is)

I realllly hope that they release more content for this game. More stories, more operations to do. More cosmetics. I purchased the collectors edition and the model is beautiful and sits next to my painting station because yes, I am also someone who collects the models, and paints them. (Playing is tough in my area, not a lot of opportunities to do so)

So yes, I fully recommend this game. Third person shooter style, good timing combat mechanics, and enough class dispersion to allow for a number of ways to play. Give it a shot.",Recommended,1224,99.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

spacefree,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spacefree/,"Big Space Marine 1 fan here, played that game for years, especially the exterminatus mode with friends.

Normally I dont buy games on first day release, but I was very excited for this sequel.

The graphics looks great. I really enjoyed exploring the maps for the dataslate and taking in the gigantic scenery of the Tyrannid Invasion. The story of the campaign was not surprising but executed very cinematic and entertaining.

Unfortunately, so far the game mechanics are only ok and feels more like a downgrade to the first one.

The whole parry, shield regen function feels clunky at best and during the first half of the Veteran campaign,I was running trough with barely HP left. Health Pack only provide like 30% healt back. The last third of the campaign felt easier to heal, but I would say it is no fun mechanic.

The AI Bots are not very helpful. At some point they didnt even pick me up during the mage boss fight. Annoying since the boss felt like fighting a bullet sponge.

Space Marine had a simple fight system, but there was a flow to it. The weapons had power. Here the Bolter are way to similar, a bit more punch to the shots would be nice, the lasgun damage is too low.

The soundtrack was also only ok, there was no track on the level of Darktide or Mechanicus.

So far PvE is fun, but I cant Tell for how long. Afterwards I will have to wait for the horde mode next year.",Recommended,1143,28.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 11

- Most bosses in the campaign are just massive bullet sponges with 2 attacks.
- Minor technical issues (stuttering, occasional immersion breaking bugs)

The scope looks grander, with epic battles against Tyranids—the perfect enemies for fast-paced, swarm-based action. I can already imagine the chaotic battles, the intense gore, and that satisfying weight behind every attack.

From a visual and gameplay standpoint, everything looks bigger and better. The environments appear more detailed, the combat seems even smoother and more brutal, and I’m especially eager to see how they’ve updated the lore and narrative. The cinematic trailers and early gameplay footage show a real commitment to honoring the 40K universe while also evolving the game.

What really has me hooked, though, is the potential for co-op multiplayer. Fighting alongside friends as a squad of Space Marines, facing insurmountable odds together—it's going to be glorious. Space Marine 2 has the potential to take everything I loved about the first game and crank it up to a new level.

From the very first moment I launched into Space Marine 2, it was clear that this game is a masterclass in delivering high-octane, immersive action. Building on the success of its predecessor, this sequel elevates the Warhammer 40,000 universe to new heights, and I can’t recommend it highly enough!

The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail in the environments and character designs is remarkable, making each battle feel like a cinematic experience. The grim, dark atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe is perfectly captured, drawing players into a world where every corner teems with intensity and epic scale.

Gameplay is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The combat mechanics are incredibly polished, offering a seamless blend of strategic depth and adrenaline-pumping action. The new and improved weapons and abilities give players a variety of ways to approach each encounter, whether you’re a fan of heavy firepower or tactical melee strikes. The sense of power and impact when commanding your Space Marine is incredibly satisfying, making every battle feel both exhilarating and monumental.

The story is engaging and well-crafted, with a narrative that pulls you deeper into the lore of the Warhammer 40K universe. The characters are well-developed, and the voice acting is top-notch, adding depth to the already compelling storyline. The plot twists and dramatic moments keep you on the edge of your seat, ensuring that the campaign is as captivating as it is action-packed.

Multiplayer is also a standout feature, with a range of modes that cater to both competitive and cooperative play. The variety of maps and the balance of gameplay make it easy to find something that suits your style, while the community feels vibrant and welcoming.

Overall, Space Marine 2 is a triumph that every fan of the genre and the Warhammer 40K universe should experience. It combines stunning visuals, fluid gameplay, and a gripping story into a package that is as enjoyable as it is epic. Whether you’re a long-time fan or new to the series, this game is a must-play.

Has full cross play for all PvE content (which is what all my play time has been so far). But if you want to play with your friends in the 6v6 PvP it's split. PC v PC only and console vs console only.

I get for the story we're all Ultra marines and the cut scenes but it would be cool if you could use your custom made marines for the campaign co-op game play.
More importantly, they should add a match making option for the co-op campaign. It is group invite only right now.

Friend and I beat it on the hardest difficulty and there was no reward or achievement unlock which is kinda lame.

They have promised hot fixes but there are issues with the match making and when you quick q can end up in a lobby with someone as the same class and they leave before you can change. It bugs out some times when trying to que and have friends join especially in the middle of a match.

From the get go what really pulled me in is the atmosphere, lore and the story. While there is not hours upon hours of that... the things that were there, are great...
The visuals are on another level, this is all i ever wanted for a WH40k game. Last achieved with the Deathwing game everything else has fallen short on the promise to deliver...
Yes, Necromunda and Darktide are ""interesting"", something was always missing.
Here... not so much... i feel like im in this world with all its brutal harshness and grotesque beauty.
The story made sense.. like 95% of the time and was interesting especially if you have played the first game. No worries you dont have to play the first one to be able to follow. But it would make more sense.

On the mechanical side of the game, this is not really my game... and by that i mean im to old to really be able to follow all the fast paced action. I try and die more often then i would like to admit, but yet i have not given up. Most interactions make sense including the inputs. The animations and the movements seem plausible and flow very nice. All in all a good game which i really enjoy to play, if im good at it or not...

One of the bad things, which has been brought up quite often is the missing for widescreen support... YET. The developer promised to get this fixed.. lets see.

All in all i had no bugs that stopped me from playing or irritated me during my playtime. In fact i would say it is one of the few examples now days that were released in a not desolated state.
Yes there seem to be bugs for several people... but i have not encountered any.

Never forget to double check, how many people are playing the game and how many reviews it got from players. It puts it very well in perspective. :)

weapons are a mixed bag, starting with the smallest category pistols. bolt pistol and heavy bolt pistol feel fine, i prefer heavy but the real outstanding one is plasma pistol, unless i have a low ammo primary i run it, it feels amazing and fluid. risk wasting time chargin up by dodgin or decide to eat the damage to get the shot off, it's accurate enough to hip fire as you close in for melee (slows you down too much in my opinion though)

melee weapons are amazing the chainsword is a great beginner weapon the knife exists, the power sword is a versatile powerhouse going from a precise fast dueling weapon to switching to a heavy horde clearing beast, the thunderhammer is a hammer, and everything looks like a nail.

primaries, i wish you could have a primary shield in the campagin along with changing armor. anywho actual primaries feel amazing, the stalker feels a little too ammo strict but other then that and the 3 carbine variants all the guns feel fun.",Recommended,988,28.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

You are a giant war machine of a person! Executions are super satisfying and the difficulty is balanced in the PvE modes. Most of the weapons feel good to use (still in the process of trying out the different classes).

I'd say the worse thing currently is the PvP. It doesn't feel balanced between ranged and melee like the first game. Also, there are certain classes that just dominate PvP compared to others. I don't doubt the devs will work on fixing some of these issues.

running with maximum graphics settings:
game runs with zero stutters even on 300 ping when i'm connected with friends in other countries
there is zero delay between my pressing a button and a response in the game, even on 300 ping
every weapon is viable on Angel of Death difficulty (though i do have a favorite, melta gun my beloved)
enjoyable game play loop that has keep me playing since the early access opened up for gold/ultramarine owners
FPS is a solid, consistent 90-110 with no drops or frame delay, with frame generation off
with it on i can hit around 300 but there's no need for it so i keep it off
the game looks exactly the same regardless of difficulty, same enemy spawn rate, special enemy spawn rate, miniboss spawn rate etc. they just have more or less health and deal more or less damage based on difficulty
my only complaint is the bots are a lil tarded but they make up for that by being tanky and reviving me after i blow myself up with a frag grenade

AAEONFLUX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AAEONFLUX/,"Will start by saying I am really enjoying this game and the negative reviews are seemingly isolated incidents in regards to crashing or it running badly and they're moaning for the sake of moaning

Using Epic to seemingly play the game is a bit meh but it hasn't subtracted from the game itself as I use Epic anyway for certain games you cannot get on Steam

I started playing on Veteran difficulty but the AI companions are a bit stupid and doing some complex objectives solo was not ideal IE the 3rd mission felt impossible to do so I had to knock the difficulty down to normal which balanced it out, maybe scaling AI intelligence based off difficulty might be the call but I am not a game dev so I can't really comment on that too much

Being able to run this game 100+ fps with minor frame drops is fantastic even though I am slightly under recommended with the recommend being an AMD 6800 series GPU whereas I have a 6750

I believe I am at the half way point of the main campaign and I look forward to playing it coop come Monday when the full game drops

Bolters don't feel like they've got a lot of weight behind the shots. The plasma rifle wasn't that impressive either. Granted, total rank and file died fast, but some of the bigger ones took upwards of 10 shots. Now, if that's because the hit box is broken, I don't know.

I wish I hadn't bought it for early access. I don't think it was worth a hundred bucks. I had the impression it was shorter than the first game, but when I checked, it took me 3 hours longer to beat this one. I think that's because the orks had a lot of personality. They actually were capable of saying things and while some of their quips got old, they at least got to be funny.

The tyranid just...run up and die. They squeal a lot. It's not as cool as I hoped.

The rest of what I'd have to say is spoilers, but after a certain point, the interest level goes up a lot. I had more fun then. Though there are some story elements that make me narrow my eyes. I don't agree with a few of the portrayals but then, I didn't write it so if that's how they needed it to go, so be it.

I'd recommend buying it on some kind of sale. At LEAST through Green Man Gaming. Get 16% off if you're going to try it.

76561198094224476,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094224476/,"At this time I have played 20 hours of the game. I beat the campaign on the hardest difficulty all missions. I have played through a majority of the side ops. And I have tried the multiplayer. Here's what I think, 8.5/10 Its almost a perfect game. For me personally its a 10/10 but for the avg person its a 8.5/10.

Thoughts:
This game has almost no bugs that I encountered that were game breaking. There was one mission where you defend chains and the ammo crates would disappear on loading checkpoint if you lost. Which made that level harder but not impossible after all I beat it. If you play with friends its a lot more fun. But this is a big solo experience game. I would recommend playing through alone just once. The story is simple but, that does not subtract from the game. After all your a big blue boy beating down baddies its not suppose to be complicated. I really appreciate how they stuck close to the original source material from the first game and the subtle call backs. I also found the sounds in the game to be amazing well done. However the soundtrack is just good nothing special. No songs jumped out at me were I was like OHHHHH YEAAA but it was there and they were doing their part. This is possibly the most well put together multiple type experience game I have played on release in a long time. This is what gaming was like in the golden age of gaming.


Summary:
This game brings back the gold age of gaming. Where gears of wars 3, halo 3, call of duty modern warfare 2 where kings. On release they are little to no bugs, lots of things to do. Tone of progression and cool cosmetics. If you don't like this game once you try it.

PvP will keep players around longer than any other mode, and atm its very plain/boring. It has no real weapon progression (like Operations has) and has NO RANKED competitive mode! This is the ultimate tool to incentive players to engage with PvP, gives player purpose, can work towards higher ranking, and entire community can get competitive around it.

The action-packed game-play and brutal combat make you feel truly powerful. The visuals and atmosphere are also top-notch, drawing you right into the gritty, war-torn future of the 40k setting.

However, the inability to use a fully-customized class in the story-mode/campaign can be frustrating, as you're locked into what the game assigns. I really enjoy playing Bulwark, so this restriction limits player choice and flexibility, which would have added a great deal of replayability, outside of the 6 currently available co-op ""operations"". Additionally, the AI of your allies when playing solo is noticeably weak. They're often more of a hindrance than a help, lacking the tactical awareness needed to support your efforts effectively, becoming more of a personal ""revive bot"" than anything else. Despite these issues, the overall experience is still a blast, with intense battles and satisfying game-play that I can foresee myself playing for awhile to come.",Recommended,880,25.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 9
Justenjoy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Justenjoy/,"This is one of the most capital V Video games I have ever played. The story is great and doesn't overstay it's welcome. I would rather an 8 hour campaign that keeps it's foot on the gas than a 40 hour slog fest.

The gameplay is solid. Tearing through Tyranids was so much fun. I will be doing it again when my friends pick this up.

Ops are great. I can't wait to see what else gets added.

PVP is just dumb fun. People are complaining about the balance and somethings I agree with, but still fun.

All that said, there are still flaws. The gameplay loop can feel slightly hollow. But if you played Helldivers or another games like it, you are used to this. I also encountered a couple camera bugs when performing executions against bosses and I missed some cool kills.

All and all, this is a very solid game. Is it game of the year? Probably not. But, this is one of my FAVORITE releases this year.

kumdanadam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kumdanadam/,"As a long-time Warhammer 40k fan, Space Marine 2 delivers everything I could have hoped for and more! Whether you're a veteran of the franchise or a newcomer to the grimdark future, this game is an absolute blast to play.

What I Loved:

🔥 Combat: The combat is fast, brutal, and gloriously satisfying. Every swing of your Thunder Hammer feels impactful, and the fluid combat mechanics make you feel like an unstoppable force of nature. The melee and ranged combat balance is spot-on, allowing you to switch between the two seamlessly depending on the chaos around you.

🎮 Controls and Movement: Movement is smooth and precise, with the agility you’d expect from an enhanced Ultramarine. The jetpack sections take things to another level—literally! Jumping into the fray from above is exhilarating.

🌌 Atmosphere and Visuals: The grimdark future of the 41st millennium is faithfully represented here. From the towering gothic architecture to the menacing presence of the Tyranid hordes, the atmosphere immerses you in the brutal and unforgiving universe of Warhammer 40k.

👹 Enemies: Facing off against Tyranids is both terrifying and thrilling. Their relentless swarming attacks keep you on your toes, and they look fantastic with excellent creature design. You feel like you’re battling an overwhelming force, yet every kill is immensely rewarding.

🎭 Story and Lore: The narrative captures the essence of Warhammer 40k perfectly. The voice acting, especially for Titus and his battle-brothers, brings out the stoic intensity of the Space Marines. While the lore is deep, newcomers can still enjoy the core storyline without feeling lost.

Minor Gripes:

If I had to nitpick, some missions could feel a bit repetitive in design, but the sheer fun of combat more than makes up for it. Also, I would love to see even more enemy variety in future expansions or updates.

Overall Verdict:

If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k or action-packed third-person shooters, Space Marine 2 is a must-play. It’s a glorious power fantasy that makes you feel like a true champion of humanity. Between the epic combat, stunning visuals, and faithful dedication to the source material, this game is a home run. The Emperor would be proud!

m_dezzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/m_dezzy/,"Let me tell you, ""Space Marine 2"" is the Warhammer 40k game we've all been dreaming of while chanting ""For the Emperor!"" in the shower. We're discussing a game that grabs you by the Power Armor and doesn't let go. I’m giving this bad boy a solid 8.5 to 9 out of 10, and here’s why it’s set the new standard for all Warhammer 40k games.

First off, the gameplay. If you thought Titus was a beast in the first game, he’s come back beefier and even more ridiculously heroic than ever. This time around, he’s rocking an even bigger gun and an even more righteous zeal to purge every alien that dares exist in his vicinity. Combat is a glorious ballet of bolter fire, chainsword cleaving, and the kind of over-the-top violence that makes Mortal Kombat look like a tea party. The fluidity of the combat mechanics makes every swing and shot feel weighty, like you're genuinely punching through hordes of Tyranids and heretics with a literal ton of ceramite-covered rage. Dont get me started on the classes. Each class feels good (however some feel better than others) and I love the progression for each type of class and weapon. It brings you back every time to catch that ""carrot"".

Let’s talk visuals. ""Space Marine 2"" looks chef's kiss gorgeous. My god there were multiple times me and my mates had to stop and just soak in the world. Saber truly captures the size of the world and how (even though we are hella tall) small we are in this grand universe. The environments are more Warhammer than the actual Warhammer lore—yes, somehow they found a way. Gothic cathedrals that reach the sky, shattered hive cities, and endless fields of carnage are painted with a level of detail that makes you feel like you’re right there on the front lines, choking on the smoke of burning heretics and inhaling the incense of Imperial piety.

Now, let's get into the narrative. Unlike other Warhammer 40k games, where plotlines are often an afterthought stapled together with grimdark tropes, ""Space Marine 2"" actually gives us a story that's engaging and, dare I say, coherent. The plot doesn't just serve as a backdrop to the carnage; it makes you care about the carnage. The game delivers on those big cinematic moments, and Titus' journey feels like it has stakes beyond just his survival—though don’t get me wrong, there's plenty of ""If it bleeds, we can chainsword it!"" action to go around.

But the true shining beacon here, the reason why ""Space Marine 2"" has set the new standard for Warhammer 40k games, is that it understands what makes Warhammer 40k special: the vibe. This isn't just a game for people who like Warhammer—this is a game for people who have ever thought, “I’d like to be the angriest man in the galaxy, preferably while wielding a gun that sounds like the angry growl of a cornered chainsaw.” It captures the sheer absurdity and grandiosity of the Warhammer 40k universe better than anything before it, and that's saying something in a franchise where the stakes are always, quite literally, the fate of the universe. I honestly believe this is what Darktide should've and could've been. But since they dropped the ball so hard nice to see someone who came in and just blew me away. I've enjoyed every second of this game and I am only hoping and praying that we continue to see live support for many many years.

Sure, it's not perfect. There are a few bugs here and there like the occasional Tyranid stuck T-posing in the background like it's auditioning for a sci-fi musical, or you're somehow flying thorugh the air, or even better you somehow ended dying on an evelaytor and then proceeded with the entire map laying on the ground without touching anything. But when you’re tearing through enemies as a Space Marine, who has time to care about a few rough edges?

So, is ""Space Marine 2"" perfect? No. But is it a blast of a game that raises the bar for what a Warhammer 40k title can be? Absolutely. If you're a fan of the 40k universe or just love some good old-fashioned over-the-top action, this game should be on your radar.

Now go, brave battle brother, and purge those xenos scum. The Emperor protects—but a solid 8.5-9/10 game experience certainly doesn't hurt either.",Recommended,3462,63.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 8

game play is solid really enjoyable i could ask for more from a 40 k game but this is a nice simple co op shooter as a new entry level for people to get interested in 40 k the devs i hate to admit as i have issues from past games did a great job here

the campaign while short is immersive and tells a compelling story altho a rinse and repeat of the first game just replace orks with nids!

the co op operations are really fun and clever how it supports the main story it just lacks content with only 6 missions to play with little variation just mob spawns it will die fast with out many more levels released !

i have not tried the pvp and it really dose not interest me !

the music is below average for a 40 k product games like darktide and mechanics really nailed the 40 k soundtracks !

insanely good graphics everything. I'am using a RTX 4080 graphics card and I7-13700KF. I get no lag problems bare a few in game glitches but nothing to do with quality of game play but DO NOT play the campaign constantly because before you know it its over and you've completed the game wish they had added more mission with more detail into different areas as there is only 5-8 campaign missions not really letting you get into enough of the characters story or detail into the campaign story enough but overall operations is very good and eternal war but i wish operations had more missions as they just just feel like certain campaign story mission copied and pasted with little different details or fighting new bosses but after completing them all over again it can get quite repetitive as you know what's going to happen next. but overall even though I've highly critiqued the games flaws it is a really good game and I do highly recommend it as it is really fun and especially with your friends or mates but i would give the game a 8-9/10 the game has only just come out so there is lots of things focus entertainment can work and edit and also add new things that will make the game a 10/10.",Recommended,1005,47.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

Graphics are insanely good, colors, design and the quality of visuals are truly the peak of modern gaming. It runs really well on my PC with good frames and only one crash in 6 hours but since I have top-end PC I cannot say how it does perform on weaker rigs.

The gameplay is the meat of the game. It is brutal, weighty, well-designed and fun. Each fight causes joy and engages the player. I have not tried multiplayer and co-op yet.

Edit - They have apparently addressed the infinite loading screens, but the character and audio lag in campaign is what's preventing me from playing any more.

This game is GREAT... when it works properly.

I want to say firstly, this is the ONLY game I've ever played where I went with the in game suggested difficulty setting, and died in the tutorial. I personally believe there are some balancing issues, but you could just as easily read this and think ""skill issue"" so I'll move on from the difficulty, but I feel as if advertising Veteran (the third out of four difficulties) as the way the game is meant to be played, may dissuade new players, especially those who may not have anyone real to fill their squad.

On to the game issues, and let me preface this by saying aside from the tutorial, all of my game time was with a friend in co-op, him on ps5 and me on PC. With that in mind the number of times we had game breaking connection issues was, unfortunately, very high. It would say he'd join my lobby successfully and then it would stick him in an eternal loading screen and he'd have to restart the game to try again. Same thing happened with me trying to join him on multiple occasions with the only solution to be, restart and try again. The final straw for me was about halfway through a mission, an elevator took us into a loading screen and when I loaded in, my buddy was stuck in the infinite load again and could not rejoin the mission even after several attempts and troubleshooting.

I personally had a lot of audio issues, where all of the audio would cut out or seem to skip every now and again, noticing it most frequently when there was a lot going on, but even at the start of the second (first real) mission while I was just standing at the start of the level the audio was skipping. I also experienced weird character animation hiccups (for lack of a better word). I would sometimes notice an enemy, or myself start an attack animation, and then hang in that first frame for a few moments until it would then skip forward and complete the ending of the animation. It's a funky issue that I've never experienced. Maybe it's graphically related, but I'm getting a pretty steady 60 frames (which is what I cap everything at) on medium to high graphic settings. So I wouldn't think it would have to do with that, but who knows. (really, if anyone knows please share)

TLDR: This game is a lot of fun when it works properly but me and my co-op buddy experienced a ton of connection issues that prevented us from playing together, and even ruined an entire mission.

I am leaving a negative review currently because this game is meant to play with a team, and right now it's hard to do that due to technical issues and infinite loading screens. There should also REALLY be a way to make a private lobby.
I'll change my review to a positive once things are ironed out a bit. Not the difficulty, as that's something anyone can change on their own, obviously.. but the tech issues need to be addressed, and I hope they are before full launch. Unfortunate that we paid extra for something so broken..",Recommended,2639,12.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

xx_raptorsc0pez_xx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xx_raptorsc0pez_xx/,"Why you should buy this game:

- Fun, satisfying, gory gameplay.

- This game is actually masculine, unlike most of the crap that has comes out of the gaming industry lately (think Dustborn and Condord).

- Amazing graphics and art direction. This game has serious style.

- Campaign AND Mutliplayer (has both PvP and PvE modes), just like how games used to be. Horde mode also coming soon.

- NO PRIDE FLAGS, NO WOKE DIALOGUE, NO FORCED ""DIVERSITY"": ABSOLUTELY ZERO WOKE TRASH (unlike Call of Duty). That way, you can actually be immersed in the game instead of being reminded every 5 seconds about the real world's societal problems. The funny part is, the main trio of the game is a white guy, a black guy, and an asian guy, but people are still crying about this game not being diverse enough. You can never please these people, so luckily this game doesn't try. This game is what REAL diversity looks like, where it is actual diversity without being cringe and forced (another good example would be Sergeant Major Johnson from Halo). Even though Games Wokeshop has been pandering to these people lately by changing the Warhammer lore, none of that crap made it past the devs into this game.

While it's not absolutely perfect, this game is a shining example of what games should be. It's immersive, it's got a lot of content, and it's just plain old fun; something that a lot of games recently don't know how to be. It is very much a golden era Xbox 360 game released in the modern day. If you don't know if you want to buy it just look up a gameplay video and if it makes you go ""Hell yea!"" then get it, you'll have a blast. I also recommend playing through or at least watching a story recap of the first Space Marine game, since this one continues the story of the original. It would also benefit you to research some of the Warhammer 40k lore since it will help you understand/appreciate the game more. Overall this game is a SOLID 8/10 and I'm glad to see the shift in gaming lately toward more games like this.


Note: They need to add an FOV slider and Ultrawide support though. Not having both of these things in a game in 2024 is ridiculous. Luckily they've already announced Ultrawide support will be added before the end of this month so hopefully they add an FOV slider at the same time. That is really my only complaint with the game.",Recommended,1931,25.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 9

1. the gameplay revolves around parrying and dodging. if you don't dodge and parry, you will die.
2. Deaths, i died 15 times during tutorial and even more during gameplay.
3. class, you dont get to play your class right away, only after campaign. everyone is bulwark class so i cant choose it.
4. difficulty, i choose normal difficulty but i just cant stop dying, its just too difficult.
5. flow of gameplay, the game forces you to parry, dodge, execute to survive. its not my style of gameplay at all, its too blocky and interupts a seamless experience that i expect.
6. dodge, parry, block mechanic.... the timing of the blocking , parrying , dodge is just impossible to get if you want to relax and switch off. my death count was maybe 100 in the game so far with only 3 hours played. its impossible

EDIT: Ok, I tried to get a refund, but they refused me, because i playe 3 hours and not 2. i posted on the forum, and everybody told me its a skill issue. I will install again and try again, but this time I will take a ranged class, instead of meele and see how it goes.. maybe ill like it again. well see....

EDIT: Ok. Now i turned the game to easy mode, It took me 2 hours to pass one mission but i made it. I smashed up my monitor in anger, but now i made it to the last level.

You might crash if you alt+tab away from the game, and some odd performance issues here and there.

Perfect parry and perfect dodge rolls don't feel consistent. Raising my chainsword to watch an enemies whip go through it and hit me doesn't feel good.

Being hit while mid-animation for doing a parry kill doesn't feel good.

Difficulty seems inconsistent and doesn't feel good (on Veteran, the games stated intended difficulty), its either a fun time fulfilling the power fantasy of a Space Marine or it's just crushingly difficult/annoying, with most of that time being spent in the latter. Even on the easiest difficulty of the co-op PvE, same experience with my friends that are long time shooter players.

Some enemy combos during missions feel cripplingly annoying. Barb wire energy spam along with locust swarm knock downs while green fog to make it so you can't see anything more than 5 feet in front of you? Or what about swarm knock downs with flying energy blasts that also knock you down, to pinball you around? All the while getting swarmed by basic melee guys. Or gun enemies shooting you in revolutionary war style firing lines from behind long waves of enemies and elites.

For me personally its just been pushing through waves of annoyance to get to the cool set pieces or brief moments of feeling like a one man army Space Marine.

Maybe it's me? Maybe it's poorly balanced? Maybe its both? I'll play more and see if my view changes or, fingers crossed, they update the game with some difficulty adjustments.

edit: lowered the difficulty to normal, and it was a much better experience. Normal felt like easy in terms of how difficult it was but at least I wasn't getting frustrated with the game as much any longer. Changed my review to positive after finishing the campaign.

Another comparison was made to Gears of War regarding controls. I have no frame of reference, but if that game feels comfortable to you, then this may be a moot point.

Missing a single block and getting staggered to oblivion is highly frustrating. I stand by this statement as the timing to block minions is very different from elites and getting locked into animations is very much a thing in this game.

All of this said, the art style of the game is amazing and nails the grim darkness of the far future, and in some cases with the swarms and what is happening in the distance of the battlefield, even better than Darktide.

After more play time and trying 5 or 6 different control set ups, I am getting somewhat used to it at this point. Still not as good as it could be, but better than my initial impression.",Recommended,981,75.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 5

This is a stark reminder of what we've lost in the gaming industry.
It's an Warhammer 40K, which follows the lore of the grimdark universe.

There are no DEI or wokeness trying to impose it's worldviews or politics.
But there are diversity... as it's always been in 40K, but there's no flagrant pandering to check any boxes.

It's just an incredibly well made game, with an incredible story that keeps you engaged.
This is a typical game that gaming community been yearning for, for years.

Is it flawless? Absolutely not. No game is, but it's incredibly refreshing to finally see a studio not being pampered with following a bunch of guidelines that shouldn't have anything to do with the game.

Relatively polished, combat is a blast, graphics are gorgeous and the environments engaging.

Added thoughts:
- Needs more operations (though I love the added bosses, new paths as you go above the lowest level).
- Needs more seamless drop in co-op - sometimes takes forever and then menus load forever etc.
- Bulwark needs a rework in PvP - too weak.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Love the general game, the atmosphere seems great and combat seems fine (albeit some keybindings being weird).

Negative review due to:
- Game being an absolute CPU nuke - water cooled my CPU is sitting at 74 degrees and this game isn't even a fraction as intensive as some I play. Seems based on community forums I am not alone in this with 80-90 degree temps even in the main menu.
- No FOV slider - you basically are sitting up the space marines backend with no ability to pull back.
- No Ultrawide support.

crashenishot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crashenishot/,"fyi: i am playing on the hardest difficulty (death angel) so some of the things i say may not relate to lower difficulties

i don't recommend getting this game in the current state, i really hope it improves however
-----
i have changed my mind, the game is really good and almost all aspects of the online modes are extremely fun, if the game stays active i can 100% without a doubt see myself grinding and playing

the story is good but i cant get over the differences between the mechanics of this game and space marine 1 and how they essentially downgraded
1. melee in this game is essentially useless, if you're against multiple enemies you WILL lose hp and armour if you even attempt it
2. melee has no rewards whatsoever, you don't gain hp from meleeing, you only gain armour, theres almost zero point to using your melee as executions can be done whilst using a gun
3. they removed stun? for some reason
4. they nerfed fury / just made it generally worse
5. you cant regen your hp using melee anymore, you have to get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ medicae stims which is really annoying

also if youre cpu isn't considered 'new gen' i don't recommend buying the game in its current state, i don't know why, possibly due to the hordes, but in story mode i near constantly am at 40 to 50 fps MAXIMUM, in pvp it's fine and stable at 70. maybe i'm just chatting ♥♥♥♥ considering i have an 11th gen i5 but oh well

some things that are good about the game though
1. almost all of the guns sound MEATY in this game and are satisfying to shoot, even the plasma gun, which sounded boring in the first game now has a deep sound that actually sounds cool
2. there's a lot of customisation options which are all really lore friendly to warhammer, you can seriously do almost whatever you want in terms of customisation, you can make a deathwatch crayon-eating autism marine if you really want to
3. there's definitely a bigger challenge in this game than in space marine 1, this is both a negative and positive though since youre really forced to sit on the backlines and work away enemies at range if you don't want to die since melee is practically useless
4. pvp is really fun and is the most redeeming quality this game has. pvp was the reason space marine 1 stayed alive/relevant for as long as it did, i'm sure the same will go to this game. the pvp is different and more 'slower paced' and enemies die quicker but i really like that as it means you actually have to be smart now",Recommended,2022,11.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 7

If you are just starting to play SM2 I would recommend Normal campaign difficulty as that is what majority of the community is playing.

Playing the campaign on Veteran difficulty felt the most rewarding and increased the play time by a bit more, but if you are brand new you may not understand why combat feels so clunky. For example, don't repeatedly try to parry, you will get stun-locked and the game will not tell you that. Instead dodge out of the way. This is one of the many things that probably should have been included in the tutorial, but wasn't.

mizturjack,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mizturjack/,"UPDATE: So, I decided to go ahead and finish the game despite sub-par performance. It's a grand spectacle, and there's a lot to enjoy. However, the game doesn't really change much at all from the opening hours to the final ones. The first game is similar, but that was also 13 years ago. The production value is insane here, so there's something to be said for that, but I really wish there was a hair more depth to the game. As it stands, it's a good sequel, but it still feels like a game from a decade past.

The performance doesn't get any better. With a 4090, my performance is the same on highest or lowest settings. At 4k, the game eventually settles around 60fps max, with LOTS of time spent in the 30s and 20s. It's just the nature of the game. It's not impressive, not by a long shot, and it's one of my major qualms with the game still. Multiplayer is pretty much a nonstop sub-60 fps fest, but it is what it is. The PvE is good fun and challenging.

In the end, I'll update my review to positive, but only because I think the overall experience is a positive one. The performance sucks, and there's not a lot of innovation here. If this was Joe Action Game, it'd be little disappointing, but as such a fan of the original game and the WH40k universe, I can't help but support and be a little biased.

ORIGINAL

The first game is one of my all-time favorite games and, aside from Rogue Trader now, my favorite WH40k game. This game, from the beginning and what little I've played, has surpassed expectations and seems like it could be the sequel we've all been waiting for.

However, even with a 4090 on lowest settings, the performance seems very disappointing (80fps at best, 45fps at worst). They've confirmed DLSS3 support coming, which likely means Frame Gen is coming, and it seems like this game needs it bad.

I hate to wait, but I'm going to have to. Cannot recommend this game in it's current state as getting 60fps consistently at 4k even with aggressive upscaling isn't possible. However, I'm hopeful for updates. As soon as Frame Gen comes to the game or we see some significant performance optimizations, I'm back in a heartbeat.",Recommended,1769,13.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 6

76561198080152820,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080152820/,"I purchased this game on a whim to play with friends, without watching the trailer, and with only seeing a few minutes of gameplay.

Initially i was impressed by the graphics, sound design, and the visceral combat. I don't know if ripping Tyranids and heretics apart will ever get old.

However, the campaign, while relatively brief, was nothing short of a masterpiece. Most co-op campaigns use well-tested tropes and techniques that we've all seen dozens of times at this point (if you're a fan of co-op games, anyway). Space Marine 2's campaign felt pretty standard at first, but i was pleasantly surprised to find a plethora of original ideas, practically all of them i won't share for the sake of spoilers.

As the campaign was reaching its end, i kept thinking to myself ""My GOD this is good"", and after every moment where i got that feeling, the next moment somehow one upped what i had just experienced, reaching a roaring crescendo towards the end. When the story was over, I felt satisfied, despite it only taking ~10hrs.

This story will leave you with memorable moments, in addition to incredible spectacle, and bad ass combat. This is easily one of if not the best co-op stories i have ever played, and i will certainly be running the campaign again on harder difficulties.

In the 15 hours i've played so far, the only bugs i've experienced were sound and camera related. I did one ""Operation"" (PvE co-op) where it sounded like my space marine was in a fishbowl during the entire mission, which i fixed by restarting the game after the mission ended. I've also had my third person perspective get a little wild during executions a few times, but it always resolved itself after a few seconds.

All in all, i don't regret paying the full price for this title. Worth every dollar already and i expect to be playing it regularly for quite a while.",Recommended,1538,16.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

76561198356630918,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356630918/,"Firstly, I can't tell you whether you should or not should buy this game. That is for you to decide on your own. All I will do is give my opinion. WARNING - THIS POST WILL CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.

This is not a review that is heavily pro or heavily negative but in the middle. ""bUt yOu rEcoMmEndEd iT"" - yes, because its positives are that its designed to primarily serve one community and that is the 40k one; but those new to this universe not so much, but I digress....

PROS:
- If you're a 40k fan, especially one who played the first game and loved it (key word - ""loved""), then this will not disappoint you in terms of its aesthetics, campaign and options to update your armour during multiplayer (eternal war) and operations mode.

- From what I can recall, compared to the first game, this one has more classes with a higher level of customisation.

- Learning the controls is easy, whatever the class and combinations are intuitive and flow mostly OK.

- Learning the levelling up system is also easy.

- If you want the exact same look at feel (just more polished) as the last game, then you will like this.

CONS:
- The game feels like it's designed as a bull run to me (especially during operations). It seems too narrow and although it's designed very similar to the first game to keep you on task, it has a flat and one dimensional look to it. Most genres of games, have moved on as tastes have expanded. It would have been so much better to have had the world expanded more given that you're a 8ft tall Primaris Astartes, running around in tank armour.

- Movement.... As stated above, you're an 8ft tall super soldier...but you can't climb over ANYTHING that isn't a set of steps or a designated pathway, nor do any form of 'parkour', nor use any ladders, you can't climb on any walls or jump AT ALL. The movement hasn't moved on at all past the first game. You can turn around, slow walk, walk, run and forward roll... To me this is just unacceptable now and the design team dropped the ball with the movement/physics. It wouldn't even be outside the lore to have the Astartes do any of the above - they'd be pretty useless marines if they couldn't do any of that, and this falls into the issue with the bull run look of the game. Nothing has moved on in this manner since 2011, and I found that a real let down. Even 343 got that right with Halo Infinite, and that's saying something given how much people have hated 343(!) But Space Marine 2 is well below standard.

- Combat. The entire system seems designed around getting you get up close (""bEcAuSe tHaTs wHaT aStArTeS dO"") so you can engage in a combat cinematic over and over again. This is not inherently bad, it's just not everything you want to do at every moment. Because of this felt need to get up close, the projectile weapons are a let down. They don't have anywhere near the impact that they should (even from a lore aspect!), and given you're fighting mass wave attacks of enemies (no matter what enemy faction), you're let down by the stopping power of your weapons. The lack of ammunition is also a problem when you can't even carry more than 200rds on you, despite the fact you're fighting enemies who's entire combat style is predicated on mass wave attacks to overwhelm you. This leads me onto the Melee/CQB weapons... These are fun, but nowhere near as effective as they should be. Again, you have to fight mass wave attacks and whilst it initially appears that you've just cut through a dozen nids in one blow, the reality is that you need to repeat that blow at least once more (combat knives take longer) to get the job done. With heavier units you need to slash through them many more times using your power sword or bash them in more with your warhammer. It just feels very deflated and ineffective and unfaithful to the lore from which this is all derived.

- Locked classes. This is a massive let down. So what if four of us want to run into a mission as Bulwark's or Heavies? The devs dropped the ball with this one also and this should be a thing of the past. People want to get together and game in their play style. They shouldn't be forced to choose one or the other.

So, it's over to you now. But in my experience, if I knew what I knew now, prior to purchase, I'd wait until its on sale and then if you really don't like it, you won't feel as let down. Unfortunately, this game hasn't moved on as far as I hoped it would have since 2011. Its fun, but when that fun is limited by game physics and play styles that are from over ten years ago, the fun can get a little dull and underwhelming. I have only put 'yes' to recommending this game if you're a real 40k fan who 'just has to have this'. If you are new to this game and 40k in general, think again before buying as you may end up quite disappointed.",Recommended,3920,21.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

My main concern is with things like progression, the story being a little bit underbaked towards the end, and overall end game content. I do hope to see that they add more content, and maybe future DLCs and stuff like that. But overall this game is for sure worth the price.

lordneep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordneep/,"6 Campaign missions is kinda light for sixty bucks, but the operations side of each of them means that you basically have 12 PvE missions to play, and the fact that all of the campaign is also co-op enabled is awesome. The game is very cool and a real tax on your CPU, moderately powered PC owners beware. That being said if you're not a warhammer fan, this might be worth waiting till it goes on sale, and it's definitely not worth the more expensive tiers at the moment.

Crossplay enabled, and seamless integration. Ive played with buddies on console with no more or less issue than playing single player currently. There's plenty this game does right, even in face of the current wrinkles it has.

It's a qualified recommend from me. I've been having a blast with it, it's the 40k vermintide I wanted from Darktide and never got. It's got some rough spots currently. A lot of crashes at startup, or trying to load things, though the good news is the crashes don't seem to happen mid gameplay. If you launch a game successfully you're not gonna crash during it. You might crash loading OUT of it, but it's never affected progress or rewards for me. Balancing seems a little off for higher difficulties, but I also see a lot of people playing the game poorly. (You can regen armor through finishers, parries, and shooting the little red target reticules! stop skipping the animations and dying as a result of it!) I expect most if not all of these issues will be ironed out in the coming month or so, and some of the server stresses atm are likely just from it being the new hot game. But these are all important in the ""need it now, can deal with that"" vs ""eugh ok maybe I wait for a month/sale"" balance.

I will say, several times during the campaign, myself and the people i was playing with had absolute jaw dropping moments of ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", or ""wait, look over there"". It's pretty in a ""next gen"" kind of way I've not felt in maaaaany years.",Recommended,1595,16.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

With this currency, you can buy cool cosmetic items for your Space Marine. I really recommend giving it a shot if you're new to Warhammer 40,000.

NOTE: Please don't listen to any bad reviews that complain about SM2's ""wokeness."" There's no ""wokeness"" in the game, it's just the game contains a diverse cast of characters are aren't all white. There's no instance in the campaign where race is mentioned subtly or explicitly. If anything, the diverse cast shows that the unity between the Ultramarines surpasses race.

Campaign is super fun to play through. Feels very similar to older 3rd person shooters such as Gears of War and other late 2000s and 2010s games. Which IMO is not a bad thing. This is AA gaming at it's best. I know nothing about 40k other than some cards from Magic the Gathering Commander Expansion, but am eager to learn more and explore this deep lore-rich universe.

Very interested to try PvE and PvP here soon, but campaign was an absolute blast. This game is very CPU bound so if you want high framerates I recommend a x3D 8 core CPU to achieve any fps above 60 consistently. More updates to come for the game and I couldn't be more excited. This is too me, a much better experience than Helldivers 2.

The game has so much potential for amazing content and features to be added to really keep players playing the game. More maps, more weapons, more armor customization, and allow for a squad bigger then three people for PvP. I understand for the other game more that having a squad bigger then three would not work, but for PvP a mode the relies heavily on team work and being able to have a team of people you know you will be able to work with is ideal. Keep adding content, keep patching the game, and within a year or two this game will go from an 8/10 to a 10/10.
As of now my score for the game is an 8/10. Highly recommend if you crave the feeling of getting a game back in 2010 and coming home unwinding to game that doesn't demand money or excessive grinding to get to a spot where you feel like you can actually play the game.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to push this from around an 8 to like a 9 or 9.5. First and foremost is the server and matchmaking issues. I spent 25 minutes last night just trying to get a game of Operations going. It's a very buggy and frustrating experience and should be priority one. This alone would fix the most glaring issue. The other thing would be to maybe do a balance pass and improve some underperforming weapons and maybe make some tweaks to the gameplay. Often times, you find yourself with a sliver of health and full armor. There are so few stim packs that this becomes a major issue and detracts from some of the fun.

The graphics are insane, the movement and animations really give the feeling of playing a 8 foot super soldier. The combat is fun, hitting a perfect parry following up with a gunstrike never gets old. The finishers are gory and glorious. The voice acting is very well done.
It has a good campaign (co-op with 2 others), some decent PvE (Operations) and PvP.

However, the gameplay loop is what you'll be doing most, if you don't mesh with it, you'll unlikely enjoy it. If you find it addicting, you'll be hooked like I am.

My only real downside is the lack of content. Campaign can be finished in 11 hours or less, and has no achievement for playing on the hardest difficulty setting.
PvE (Operations) only has 6 maps with little variation between difficulties.
PvP only has a mere 3 maps, with 3 game modes and has it's own set of issues.

An Epic account is needed for online. Only PvE & Campaign are crossplatform. PvP is not.

PvE is very barebones (3 maps with 3 modes) but is surprisingly fun with very quick sub 10m matches. The best part about this game by far is the customisation options, you can really make a space marine to call your own (RIP on chaos customisation though).

The controls encourage you to take control of your camera. If you accept that you will have your fingers on your sticks at all time, the game gets a great flow. It also is absolutely worth it if you have back buttons on your controller. This is a game you can get very good at. It features a very fluid mixture of melee and ranged combat. With parrying, dodging, point-blank shots and executions. Combat is very involved.

You want to play this with a very good controller. With mappable back buttons. Or you will be pressing down your sticks.

I got it to look gorgeous on a 6800XT. No issues. Steamdeck? No. Even if you set everything to low you will play at 24fps while the 'nid soup is the thickest. Precisely when you do not want that. I have admittedly not tried everything and you may be getting two or so more fps if you want. But you will not get 40fps while in combat. Streaming works, tho.

Overall, two hours in I got exactly what I wanted. Can't say anything about multiplayer.

Also, this game feels like it is a plattform for more things to come. Well worth your 60 bucks or more if you think pretty paint jobs for Space Marines are worth the extra money. This being 40k you probably do.

But for those who wants more convincing:
DISCLAIMER: This is a hybrid hack and slash + 3rd person shooter. You will run out of bullets so learn the melee combos.

-Single player
I bought in with the expectation for a good single player game and it sure is an extremely pretty looking game.
The story is a concentrated testosterone serious to the bone hero who is fighting against all sorts of evil and the atmosphere of the environment strongly immerse you onto how grim the situation is being the last bastion of mankind.
Though it only takes me about 10 hrs to complete the campaign, it is definitely not an easy game and dying is inevitable especially for those who do not posses the tactical awareness and reflex to avoid damage from quick time events.
The game force you to not rely on your guns as the shear volume of enemies thrown at you challenge you to consider using your ammunition strategically as melee combat is inevitable, and at the same time running in blindly with a sword is also a guaranteed death sentence. Focus on environmental hazards like explosive barrel and the likes to take out swarms and remember to use you grenades and you will find success especially on the higher difficulty settings.
Your AI companion are just walking emotional support characters as they don't seem to do much against enemies and their only purpose is the draw enemies attention away from you and revive you when ever you go down.
I personally have not try this feature but it seems that you can invite friends to join you in your single player campaign and I do hope that would spread the work load of killing, making it more enjoyable to progress.


There is Co-op and Competitive mode.
I have yet try competitive mode as i am not profoundly interested in that aspect, however the co-op game play currently still contain game breaking bugs which could prevents you from loading into a game. This occurs randomly (every other game). The Dev's seems to be aware of it and has pledge to fix it in the up and coming patch, thus I'l hold them to it and update my review when i see it fix.

There are a good amount of classes, variation and upgrades for the multiplayer mode that I can foresee giving the game much longevity. The Co-op mode is much more enjoyable than the campaign due to the fact that actual player are contributing to the fight, sharing the burden of the onslaught. Teamwork is still important as a singled out player can be easily dispatched by a swarm.

The animations and sound design are great, everything has a lot of weight to it whether you're stomping around the battle barge or firing a heavy bolter into a swarm.
The melee weapon balance is bonkers though, knives outperform Thunderhammers and Power Fists against every enemy type, they're just too slow and do too little damage. Really disappointing to see iconic 40k weapons just left as afterthoughts, they don't mesh with the combat system at all.
Could have used more execution animations too, it becomes really obvious that there's only a couple after the first few missions.
That being said there's a lot of replayability in the PvE content due to how fun the combat is. The ""not Tyranid"" missions suck because the whole combat system just doesn't feel as good against more standard enemies, thankfully they're only 2.5 out of the 6 maps.

Its not perfect but its good (a little bit too much price)
here some personal problem:
1 sever errors it drops me out of middle of pvp for no reason (they gonna fix it sooner or later )
2 no female skin (i dont care personally) even there are no women space marines there are female chapters
3 two handed sword for melee class (bulwark as well pls)
4 control its just makes weird right mb melee mb goes for aim and after years of for honor its not easy my set up correctly is good for melee but hard for shooting my suggestion is: make a custom made control scheme per class so everybody can play his own way
5 not the worst thing but you need to play the previous game to understand the ending
6 pve progress not goes for pvp (not entirely) put a little bit of balance there (not much)
7 not game fault but you need at least 3 friend to trully enjoy the game i played so far 15 match in pve mode and one them was the perfect battle-brother felling.

76561198057332257,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057332257/,"A simple and fun game that feels like it came out of the Xbox 360 era in terms of what it offers. You get a solid campaign, a fun co-op mode with some replay-ability and a decent albeit unbalanced multiplayer experience without any obtrusive microtransactions.

Space Marine 2 will likely only get better with time, especially once they introduce the horde mode which seems what much of the game was designed for.

My biggest complaint about the game though is its difficulty/balancing. The game in itself is not hard in most scenarios, but having played through the story on the hardest mode and sunk a few hours into multiplayer I think there are some things that need major tweaking.

For starters, the Armour/health system is awful. Armor is weak and you get melted by the 20-30 by gunners mixed into a crowd of swarms. The difficulty is artificial at best and is only made worse by how tanky enemies are. On Angel of Death (The Hardest difficulty) some enemies can take a literal 120 rounds of a heavy bolt gun depending on the range. That is 3 full magazines of ammo which is almost your entire ammo reserve. And these aren't even bosses, these are just common enemies that you fight over and over. It leads to so many fights being such a slog and because of the sheer amount of ranged units mixed in with melee units mixed in with specials that just constantly AoE you, you are forced to sit behind cover near ammo just whittling enemies down.

The game feels like it wants you to engage in more melee combat, but melee combat doesn't refill your health like it did in the first game so you are constantly out of health and armour as the only way to restore it is through stimpaks which seem to barely exist and refill very little health or Titus special tactic which takes like 10 minutes to recharge. I think if you restored health from melee combat the game would make more sense but for the moment its just frustrating because you will either get shot or jumped on from enemies that are off screen that you have no idea are there and this just repeats for the entire game. Some missions are especially frustrating as you are forced to defend objects while 40 enemies will be jumping on you preventing you from moving and slowly taking damage, all the while you are being shot at and explosions from other specials go off around you. Sometimes it feels like you don't even have time to shoot and you are forced to make the choice of lose 90% of your health or take the objective.

Multiplayer doesn't have the issue as health and armour will restore on their own over time and it is quick. But multiplayer definitely needs some balancing. Some classes are simply just way better than others and because you are limited to only 2 players per team using a single class, someone has to take the lesser class. Vanguard especially is broken as they can grapple you and in a 1v1 situation, it is a guaranteed loss for you unless you have team mates backing you up that can kill the attacker while he is stuck pulling towards you.

Overall, the game is solid and I do highly recommend it for what it offers, but there is definitely lots of improvements that can be made. There is so many little issues that seem to add up that can make the experience frustrating at times but they are fixable.",Recommended,2703,16.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

pokica,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pokica/,"I do recommend the game, but... with some caveats.

Are you a Warhammer 40k fan? Get it.
Are you an arcade shooter fan that wants to smash some stuff in a very satisfying way, but doesn't care about the challenge? Get it.
Do you want to experience the 40k world in all its glory? Definitely get it.
Played the Space Marine 1 and want to finish the story, sure. Get it.
The hype around it is justified, because we finally get a good 40K game.

Now, let's talk about the ACTUAL game.

The world building is incredible. Attention to detail and the lore is out of this world. Everything looks and feels like someone hearing about 40k for the first time might imagine it. It is beyond beautiful. Art direction is mind blowing.
Graphics are incredible, VFX is impactful and animations are weighty and very well done overall.
Whoever figured out the optimization is a dev god and nothing less. Besides LODs, I see a lot of smart use of video/sprite particles that imitate 3D objects that add to the swarm combined with 3D models. It is so smartly done that I was just dumbfounded by how intelligent these devs are. This game runs WAY BETTER than it is supposed to.
Narratively the game is pretty solid. A good continuation of the story from the SM1 with a lot of explanations of what happened and why it happened. It paints a very bleak story open to discussion and puts Titus as one of my favorite game characters. His devotion and lack of ego is actually quite refreshing. Dropping one faction you were fighting mid campaign to fight the other is a bit clumsy, but so was SM1. Oh well.
When it comes to my solo campaign NPC teammates - I am torn. I grew to like them at the end, but for space marines, they act like petulant children and tend to piss me off. I like that they have some banter, but sometimes the way they behave is very unsoldierly like. It is like having two toddlers around at times...
In SM1, when Leandros reaches his boiling point (don't worry, spoiler free), he is passionate. Otherwise, there is a professional coldness to everyone's demeanor which is very befitting the Astartes.
Voice acting is so so SO good! Characters actually come to life with the level of acting and I appreciate all the effort that went into it.
Sound and music is also very solid. I don't remember any songs sticking out, but hey, I have the Mechanicus soundtrack for that.
Talking about Mechanicus, I love how they speak in their binary gawking. Super cool.

Level design is serviceable. It is mostly fine, but due to the combat requiring items and ammo, you will look around for resources only to end up at a dead end making you trot all the way back. It can get annoying, but it is okay.

Tyranids are a cool enemy narratively and thematically, but now we get into the weakest element for me personally, which is ironically the combat.
The way the combat is built is around tactical and precise shooting, with timed parry mechanics that regenerate your armor and health that is immediately depleted. The depleted health is reduced quickly so you have to get aggressive in order to replenish it, before it permanently drops. It can only be recovered by stims (which you will be chasing around constantly therefore level design can get annoying). Here is the kicker - Tyranids are nasty bug like aliens that have a weird body build. This means it is hard to read their moves when they telegraph an attack that you NEED to parry. The game throws a UX solution at you - blue notification overlay means PARRY, red notification means DODGE. The thing is - some tyranids attack right away when the blue flashes, some delay, some combo the move. The UI overlay distracts me from the actual moves. I finished the campaign on the Veteran difficulty and I can say that the game is so easy when you get to the Chaos section that Tyranids feel like the true enemy. Chaos are humanoid so reading them is much much more simple than the bugs.
The combat always feels a tiny bit off. You have moments where it is a power fantasy and you are just murdering. The other times, I am cheesing the game by staying out of enemy sight and picking them off. Even worse, I am dodging more than in a soulslike. What happens when you add a dodge roll, but no stamina on increased difficulty? You get bullet sponge bosses, aggressive attacks and you, a super soldier in tank armor dodge rolling like you're playing Elden Ring.

Friendly NPCs are useless in a fight. Difficulty is pretty much broken. As I mentioned, Veteran difficulty is me finishing it solo and using NPCs to rez me. Bosses are bullet sponges. All AI targets YOU. It can get very frustrating and I turned off the game a few times because of these moments.
I am doing operations now and it gets better with people, but doesn't every game?
Multiplayer is a lot of fun, but again, there is an issue with the parry system - I spent this whole time learning perfect parry and, logically, the PVP doesn't have it.
I am not a fan of a game teaching me a mechanic I have to rely on heavily with it being completely gone from the PVP.

So, I might get crucified for this, but I am not a huge fan of the combat. I want to do more operations and PvP, just because I want to unlock stuff, but I wouldn't replay it. I think it is a bit lukewarm. Sometimes the input felt like it was lagging and I am not sure if it is 100%. I know that it certainly felt this way because some moves - you are lightning fast. Others, you are sluggish and heavy.

Conclusion - for the true 40K fan and for the 40Kurious people out there that like arcade games.

BulldogJ3ster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BulldogJ3ster/,"SM2 - in its current state Brings you three prongs of content: First, a curated and well-written campaign, with 3 player coop (with unique interactions when played in such a manner, which was a nice touch). The two characters your ""battle-brothers"" play in said coop are fully written into the story whether they're piloted by the computer or your mates, and are not just jobbers who spectate the main characters' tasks. Being someone into the warhammer universe, I was presently aware of a lot of the story aspects - however friends of mine who are not in the scene at all also enjoyed the story and plot provided.

Secondly, Operations. There are missions performed by side characters, also written into the story, representing different ""classes"" which each have full progression trees; with additional progression for your weapons independant of the classes (meaning if a class shares a weapon, you progress it for all classes that use said weapon). I found the way these were associated with the story very interesting, made ""yourDude"" feel impactful and cool. Difficulty rides on your level as well as your skill, you can't just jump to the top difficulty and complete everything on its hardest and call it a day, you gotta work for it, which I prefer as it feels like myDude is actually progressing.

Finally, PvP. In its current state, its decently balanced and simple in all the right ways. Melee can be a bit of a miss, but besides from that it's a fantastic experience and what I have sunk the most hours in thus far. The classes are the same as those you play in Operations - and the visual customisation carries across - but the loadouts differ, a promising prospect indicating that PvP will be balanced in isolation, a thing which lots of PvE/PvP games don't like to do for some reason. I see a lot of people complain that they can't beat X, or that Y is too strong, and 99% of the time i've seen that - its because they're not using the thing that definitely helps counters said strong thing. 3 (with more to come) game modes keeps things varied, though everyone i've met has their favourite they primarily queue into, and three maps (also with more to come) - whilst small in number - I feel are incredibly well designed and thought-out from a gameplay perspective, making me look forward to the additional ones coming.

We know both operations and pvp are going to be recieving ongoing content patches, we'll be getting a survival game mode, and more as the game lives - none of which will be paywalled. The only paid DLC will be cosmetic, like the good old days.

Games like this, and Wukong, are great examples of AAA titles releasing in complete packages. Rife with content, stable and performing well (my rig isn't fantastic, rocking a 2060 gpu) was a lovely surprise. at £55 quid I think this is a great retail release, and the sequel the first deserved and more; bringing awesome visuals and mechanics alike.",Recommended,2422,71.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

For the same price as other big titles you get a masterfully paced, story driven, three player coop campaign that requires no previous knowledge of Warhammer 40k to be invested in. A working multiplayer PvE mode that has a scalable difficulty for when you progress. A functional PvP mode with quick action rounds and a fairly balanced feel (I have found that this does suffer with server issues during busy times, requiring you quit to menu).

This is however, still a brand new game with its own issues. Over a week into this game I have completed all the Operations (PvE missions) at least once on normal difficulty and played on all the PvP maps with all game modes. I still have yet to try my hand at every class and I am not even close to unlocking everything 56 hours in, but ultimately, I have already seen all of what the current state of the game has to offer. Nothing has felt like a grind thanks mostly to the combat system, which is so simple and gratifying that I grin a little bit whenever I run out of bullets and it's time for close quarters.

Scratching the hack and slash, brutal shoulder to shoulder coop and challenging tactical fighting itches all at once, I will recommend the base version of the game without dlc or season pass for now (as this is all cosmetics that wont mean much to new people!).

kappaomicron,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kappaomicron/,"So I've now beaten the campaign in co-op with one friend and also played every PvE mission at the first difficulty level. I'm unsure if I'll touch the PvP mode yet as that doesn't really interest me.

But after trying the PvE missions at higher difficulty to unlock more stuff, my enjoyment in the game dwindled fast. I have been playing the Heavy Class and using the Heavy Bolter because I love using miniguns like that, and all was going well until I hit level 8 and joined a friend on the 3rd difficulty setting which gave me a warning that the minimum level is 10.

I didn't think 2 levels would really make that much of a difference but I quickly found my gun not doing nearly as much damage as it had been before and the enemies hit a lot harder and there is much fewer items and healing heals less.

Looking up in the discussions on the game, it seems that people recommend using the Melta gun as a Heavy, but I would prefer to stick with my Bolter. It seems the enemies become more bullet sponges at higher difficulty rather than adopting more advanced tactics for the player to deal with, which is very disappointing. Too many games nowadays go for the bloated HP route rather than adding more complex gameplay to up the difficulty.

It also doesn't help that the PvE mode only consists of 6 missions as of writing, and 5 of those missions are tied to the campaign that gradually unlock once you reach a certain point, that gives you a glimpse at a different viewpoint playing as different marines in a mission that happens alongside some of the campaign ones.

Which is cool, but the linear missions can get boring pretty fast. I might continue playing them to fully unlock everything for the Heavy, but I doubt I'll stick around to do another or I may even give up entirely before even doing that.

I wish they had a more procedurally generated mission structure that took place on several planets and would switch up the missions to create an illusion of you being marines going on infinite missions.

I think the lack of a Horde Mode which is extremely popular and that it won't be coming until later in 2025 will end up killing this game's current high player-base. The current PvE is just too linear.

The campaign was absolutely amazing though, I love every single minute of it. I've seen some people complain that it's too short, but I would argue that the campaign was at a fairly decent length. Most Call of Duty campaigns are like 4-5 hours long, this ended up being over 12 hours for me, and that's not including the additional hours I spent taking a break from the campaign to do the unlocked PvE missions as they came.

I wish the campaign was longer though because it was so awesome being a Space Marine and destroying. It felt so satisfying. That's probably why I'm not enjoying the higher difficulties of PvE currently, because I find myself constantly rolling away from enemies and feeling like a paper doll rather than a genetically altered super soldier.

I hope they release an expansion with another campaign, I would gladly pay more money for that for sure.",Recommended,2543,17.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

Fun and exciting story campaign that picks up where Space Marine 1 left off, with all around game play improvement from mechanics to UI. A 3 player coop story mode is too dang rare these days which really sets this game apart from others.
The game expands on this with coop PVE missions that tie into the main story campaign which breaths additional life and provides deeper game immersion.
The games combat features varied enemy/ boss types that each require different techniques to bring down. The Carnifex being my personal favorite.

Haven't had a chance to play a ton of the PVP but so far it's fun -definitely much different play style to the PVE. Discovering how each class translates to the pvp is interesting and its pretty cool how the Chaos faction get some unique chaos legion armor sets. Lets go Alpha Legion!!!

die_happy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/die_happy/,"So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.",Recommended,3498,80.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

76561198056929744,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056929744/,"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT
- Excellent game with high production values. Well done to the developers and I am happy to support them
- Highly recommended time sink if you want mindless fun for an hour or so, or want to take a break from your other main games
- Extremely smooth, addictive gameplay. Consistent 60FPS on ULTRA settings
- Beautifully executed game package - while campaign is short, there's plenty of options in PVE and PvP
- Not necessarily worth the $89.95 for the 8 or so hour campaign with only 3 planet locations with 6 maps in total, however the production values is what makes one of the best games I've played in recent times
- The parry system does not feel quite right, it's very clunky and you take damage anyway almost making parries useless in some scenarios
- The in-game animations during some mandatory actions where you take damage can annoy some players
- The game's linear style similar to old school games like Ghost Recon Future Soldier may put off some players. The game's insane attention to detail and mechanics prove not all action games don't have to be ""open world"" and the linear style does serve the game well

OVERALL 9/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND even if you're not a Warhammer fan

GRAPHICS (9/10)
Pros
- Fluid and nothing short of stunning
- No noticeable lag with so many things on screen
- Set pieces are stunning and accurately captures the dark world of the 40K series

Cons
- Some off the distant set pieces or flying Nids flicker sometimes but it is not readily noticeable

SOUND (10/10)
Pros
- I've got a Bose sound bar and subwoofer and feeling the thud and crack of every weapon is insane. Whoever was in charge of sound needs a raise

Cons
- Nil

GAMEPLAY (9/10)
Pros
- Fast, fluid and responsive
- Movement is precise and you can feel the weight of the armour with every step and finishing kill animation

Cons
- You take damage during mandatory action animations. Hopefully the developer can balance this as your health and armour gets stripped very quickly no matter what difficulty you are playing
- The parry system and melee are clunky - it doesn't feel as smooth as games like Ghost of Tsushima, which has a similar parry system with the blue (heavy attacks, can be parried) and red indicators (special heavy attacks, can't be parried)

LONGEVITY (6/10)
Pros
- The game has some random spawning in Ops maps, which vary the game somewhat, but you can generally predict where enemies will spawn
- If you have friends to play with it's extremely fun and addictive
- The developers released a roadmap for 2024/2025 which looks to add more maps, weapons and content. If these remain a free update to the base game and separate from paid DLC cosmetic content then this is a welcome change from other game developers which block certain base game content and functionality behind a paywall. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE!

Cons
- The Ops (PVE) can get repetitive and boring for the number of maps available
- There is a significant delay sometimes when waiting at the launch bay. Not sure there is a bug, but it definitely occurs when someone leaves or joins your squad
- PvP seems a bit unbalanced and not as engaging as PVE

The game-play does need some tweaking or some of the mechanics explained better, as you can be overwhelmed very quickly and it might just be me but its very hard to break out, without dodge/retreating which is not how I envision Space Marines fighting.

PVE GOATED, PVP not so much but i came to fight heritics not my fellow battle brothers, Story mod is god teir. excellent progression imo, my only gripe is some small balancing problems (Bulwark & hammer users looking at you) that im sure will get fixed later on, no crossplay for PC and console in PVP (most of my friends are on console so kinda a bummer), and the fact we are just waiting on the devs to deal with the very rare cheater in pvp (again dont really care about pvp but to those who do give them time to collect data on the cheat software to start doing ban waves) and lastly some of the fodder NPC's able to take bolter round after bolter round and be fine because of a shield.

GinRuki23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GinRuki23/,"As a long-time Warhammer 40,000 fan, this game is a masterpiece at launch.

Pros
- The storyline takes place on several planets, with the Imperium dealing against a Tyranid splinter fleet. Not too overwhelming as an actual fleet but still a threat regardless lorewise.
- The story focuses on Titus's continued storyline and redemption, with the general character and storyline development being solid writing.
- The details of not just the character design but the armor, weapon, and layout is amazing, incredible work to their visual and graphics team. Throughout the campaign and operations, just take a moment to take in the view.
- Some of the weapon designs are feel lackluster, but others are so satisfying to use, this is both a pro and con.
- The class system seems iffy at first, and I've only played about 2 classes so far, both are decent, but as far as I know the builds are quite solid with varying types of gameplay per-class.
- Operations are a good way to provide an alternative viewpoint to the campaign, with different characters and quite a satisfying amount of customizability

Cons
- The loading times and connecting times to multiplayer can be abysmal, disabling crossplay seems to have fixed it for me, but I've read that it doesn't always work for others.
- The campaign is short, each mission is lengthy and satisfying, but I still hope they manage to expand on the mission in future updates and expansions.
- You do occasionally come across dodgy team members on matchmaking, with dodgy tactics, but you can always launch solo operations with AI instead, and most times you should be getting good players.
- The weapon designs' cons section would be related to some weapons feeling lackluster, they refined how it works compared to the first game, and it does indeed have weight, but it hasn't achieved that sweet spot yet. For example, Auto Bolt Rifles, Heavy Bolt Rifles, and just plain Bolt Rifles don't feel that much different, when they should.
- My only gripe on the class system is how some of the weapon loadout restrictions can be quite iffy and too restrictive. For example bulwarks not having a heavy bolt pistol, tactical can't use a combat knife or only restricted to a bolt pistol.

Overall the game is amazing, a definite must buy experience for any warhammer 40k fans. And to elaborate on why there are no female space marines, it's because their gene seed used in stabilizing their implants are coded to only male zygotes, this was done potentially to control the space marine population and not have them replace humanity completely. Also please read up on Adepta Sororitas and the Anathema Psykana, literal female Adeptus Astartes and Adeptus Custodes equivalents.",Recommended,2264,90.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

Steam doesnt have the original gears series but this game reminds me so much of the intense gore and gripping fight interactions. the combat is very similar, minus the cover and replaced with melee combat. gun-play is easy to get a hold of but the game forces you to start spraying rather than count your shots with endless hordes of enemies. one thing that gets on my nerves is the lack of mobility, i get it i am a tank but give me options of movility trade offs. for example in the campaign you're locked into a certain ability ecxept a few parts, it would be nice to be able to choose an alternate ability like the grapple or assault pack in the armory before a mission. overall enjoying the game",Recommended,720,7.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 16

If you were a fan of the first one or a fan of the IP in general you've already bought it before you read this. For those on the fence this is one of the best action games ever made. I've played it on veteran (Intended experience according the difficulty selection) and found every combat encounter to be a visceral fight to the death that i just managed to emerge victorious (no thanks to my AI squad who couldn't hit a cows arse with a bango!). All the lessons have been learned from the first game giving you, in my opinion, the most immersive experience in the un-apologetically serious and beautifully gothic world of 40k.

The game does get a little samey after a while and matchmaking can be a pain if someone is playing the same class. One of you will have to change. You will likely need to level a few different classes if you are not playing with friends.

If you have an adequate GPU, none of the settings really make a difference if you are CPU bottlenecked. The link below has some good baseline settings. If you have an older cpu, like my 9900k, I suggest setting the render resolution to dynamic and target 60 fps. Then make sure you set the frame limit to 60 fps or it will try to overshoot the target and will look blurry. Check out this persons guide video.

The controls feel wonky and bad at first but by the first third of the campaign they feel natural enough. I only played on Keyboard+Mouse. I've heard that controller ""feels better"", might try it down the road.
The pacing is fantastic by the time you begin to tire of a certain activity or beat, the game switches things up.
The scope and scale of the story is HUGE, and EPIC.
Speaking of Epic, don't let the chatter about EGS's add-on's keep you away from this, I agree that a disclosure should've been made, but I simply can't see review-bombing the game over it.

You are part of the Space Marines 2, which is the second Space Marine squad sent out to the distant stars to aid in the ongoing war against Russia. Luckily, you are not on this mission alone. Private James has 3 squad mates that fight with him. Dih, Foo, and Cuh will be your war brothers throughout this ~40,000 hour long campaign.

Лично для меня, как для вахафанатика (DEbila), игру вытаскивает обертка из этой вселенной, её эпос/атмосфера/арт-дизайн вложили больше положительного, чем сам геймплей и сценарий. Именно поэтому я бы её рекомендовал, НО тут можно начать придираться. Суть в том, что игра пытается в МАСШТАБ и ЭПОС 40К, у неё получается ПОЧТИ. Иногда чувствуешь, что этого МАЛО и как-то неуклюже, по нищему сделано (по факту 10 из 10 АБСОЛЮТЕ КИНЕМА момент для меня был в конце с флагом и ВСЕ). Плюс эти кат-сцены с загрузками, которые руинят иммерсивность, мало эпичных анимаций добивания и многое другое.

Core геймплей приятный, но душит и надоедает со временем однообразием. Разработчики не придумали никаких интересных задач, прокачки персонажа (для сюжета) или гимик боссов с какими-то классными идеями.

PvE операции классные и более интересные, чем основные миссии (WTF??). Тут тебе и с Тираном Улья дают подраться, и с Хеллдрейком есть гимик битва. Классы есть, прокачка оружия/персонажа, более тесная командная работа, влияние на мейн сюжет игры.

PvP прикольное, не более.

Ну, в общем, 7/10 если по ФАКТУ (а как вахафанатик, то может и 8/10). Ждем триквел, вот там будет мега бюджет и тру эпос ВЕРЮ

76561199093828460,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199093828460/,"I absolutely love this game however the combat is extremely unforgiving sometimes. I notice that sometimes I will spam the parry or dodge button and watch as my character sits there doing nothing but taking hits, It is also really difficult to maintain a decent amount of health due to the limited amount of ways to heal and the number of enemies that attack you at the same time. There are more minor issues like the blockable and unblockable attacks having the same sound effect, fodder units being tanky against bolters, unusual hitboxes, perfect parry/dodges being off on some enemies, etc. Performance wise I think the game runs very well, I haven't had any framerate issues whatsoever. The main issue that I and many others are experiencing are server issues. Most of my time playing is waiting for people to join or for me to join, that or I have to go back to the main menu because the game seems to not be able to connect me to anyone. Loading will either take a long time or just be infinite. I also struggle to get matches with three people instead of just two.

76561198048848795,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048848795/,"Man, I was not expecting this to be this good. Never played the first game or the tabletop versionn, went in blind on the recommendation of a friend with refined taste.

Epic. Bleak. Bad ass. I went in thinking this was going to be just another ""dude-bro hell yeah brother"" game. I wasn't wrong but it does it so well, I was never bored by it. The story and the environments were so epic. Great writing and voice acting, and some excellent sound design.

The combat has some surprising death. Again, I thought it was going to be shoot-y chainsaw sword swing swing. I wasn't wrong, but there's more to it. Combos, regain shields on execution, parry for cinematic headshot opening, and more. I started and finished on the Veteran difficulty. I felt like I really won every fight and was often left hoping I could make it alive through the next one.

My feedback:
I really like the campaign, operations, and how those are tied together. However, I found myself wanting to just do the operations because I wanted to customize and level up, and I was disappointed that the campaign didn't contribute to any sort of progression in operations. I really wanted to level up and get gear for operations, and I was really feeling not working toward that while I was playing the campaign.

The season pass really doesn't feel like a good value right now. You get access to some colors and emblems, but then you have to grind for currency to unlock them, and that currency is also used to level up your weapons. Progression also feels really slow in operations.

I was a little surprised at the lack of visual customization. There's some colors and emblems like I mentioned, and then just a couple of helmets, slight variation on other armor pieces, and small adornments that you can add. I saw an NPC space marine with a leather cape that would be cool to have. More helmets, cool armor pieces, and weapon skins would be welcome.

Lastly, being able to just create a character for operations would be nice. I know you can't pull a character creation system out of thin air, though.

tekwerk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tekwerk/,"It's not quite the original, which is funny because the original is a fairly middling game elevated only by the fact you get to play a smash captain, but it's still a good time. This game trades the balanced, linear campaign and mix of gunplay and melee for a hub based mission framework and a more intricate melee system, at the expense of pacing and the shooting. The shooting is serviceable but the different varieties of bolt rifle are fairly underwhelming, as are the melta weapons. The only standout guns are the snipers for their big headshot damage and the plasma weapons for being able to deal effective damage with charged shots. This is a game you play to get in the thick of things. The operations are fun little bite sized chunks that were probably taken out of the main campaign, but are fun nonetheless.

AUSImperator,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AUSImperator/,"FOR THE EMPEROR!!! What a truly fantastic sequel! If you loved the first one (I know I sure did!) your going to love Space marine 2 because it just gets better and better. The campaign is just epic & from the moment I stepped into the boots of Demerian Titus once again, I just couldn't get enough.

The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're hacking & slashing your way through hordes of Tyranids with a Chainsword or a Power Sword or mowing them down at range with Bolters, I mean, It doesn't matter because it is just incredibly satisfying either way and pulling off those savage executions, It just never gets old, EVER!.

I don't think it will be any surprise, but the game's visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are immersive & highly detailed & they really do capture the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in the cityscapes of Avarax or alien-infested swamps of Kadaku, it all looks stunning and immersive.

In Conclusion, If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40K or if you just love third-person action games, Space Marine 2 is an absolute must-play. It’s everything you could ever want from a sequel and then some.

reiken_birge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/reiken_birge/,"Bruvahs! Why haven't you picked up this game and served the emperor yet?

Seriously it's pretty great.

Campaign: Awesome.
Operations: Awesome
All the classes/weapon: Awesome.

The look and feel of the world alone is well worth it to pick up this game but with all the top tier gameplay, customization and more? Yeah no it's been a long time since I've had such an easy recommend. I think most anyone would love playing this.

Now if I had to pick one thing to gripe about though it's the PVP. Generally speaking it's a fantastic experience but the melee design decisions there left me scratching my head. There's no stagger for most if not all melee attacks and the awesome parry system we learned to use in operations/campaign also doesn't do anything except block all melee damage. It's strange, I don't like it, but I've learned to play around it.

There's also some weird design decisions with the Assault Marine class for Operations that really didn't need to be there but they're pretty minor so they don't bother me after I learned how the class works in that mode. It's currently my second highest level class and definitely a lot of fun.

Now if they could remove the class limit on Operations I'd love to run a full assault marine group because that just sounds awesome.",Recommended,1065,59.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

It's a full featured game with outstanding visuals, good story that can be played in co-op, operations that tie in the main story and an old school PVP a la TDM, CTF and CP.

I do need to warn you. The trailer makes it look easy and gives the impression that you'll be mindlessly going in full hack and slash. You won't. This is actually a hard game that requires a bit of tactics, quick thinking and you'll have to properly learn how to use your weapons. At later difficulties, you'll end up dead in mere seconds if you're not careful about how you approach your fight. Once you start mastering the melee combat, you'll really enjoy the fights.

The AI is utter trash so the campaign can be much harder than it needs to be, but it's not too bad. There will just be times where you will get utterly demolished because your AI bug out and then the next time you try level you will wonder the ♥♥♥♥ you failed the first time until you remember AI.

Operations is super fun except for like every game you will get some toxic teams who will kick you as soon as you join so you set through multiple loading sections for no reason vs just closing your squad. Also leavers are pretty punishing because they get replaced with AI, which see above is trash. Also you can't have multiples of the same class so stubborn standoffs get old.

All that being said, the game is extremely epic. some of the situations you will get in will make you feel like a true angel of death and other times you will be barely hanging on against hordes of enemies. The highs from this game are next level and will be even better when they iron out a few bugs/janky mechanics.

Negatives. Gameplay is very very simple you will see basically everything you can do within the first hour. Barely evolves from the beginning to the end and if you aren't okay with that then it will not be a fun ride. No HDR for whatever reason creating a sort of hazy gray across the whole game. If you have access to the NVIDIA app you can put their HDR filters and that will make the game look just that much better and give deep blacks to the scenes which it really needs considering the dark worlds.",Recommended,573,11.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The single player campaign has breathtaking scenes, great combat, and a good story that isn't too complicated for 40k beginners while still having those fun little details that more hardcore fans will love. The re-playable coop operations tie in seamlessly with the main story while adding a fun progression system that will take up most of your time in this game. It speaks volumes that I have loved this game and played for over 90 hours without even touching the pvp, which i've heard can be really fun. This game is so good and hopefully sabre will keep it running with new content for years to come.



Game improvements i'm hoping for (INCLUDES SOME SPOILERS):

Class Locking - One class per team in PVE should be taken out as even though 3 tacticals would be powerful, i dont think it would be better than the current tac, sniper, and heavy combo as long as you cant stack abilities from the same class i.e. auspex scan 3 times at once.

Weapon buffs - a few weapons like the melta and bolter w/ grenade launcher feel really good but many bolter type weapons don't hit with the correct power. I get that the glitch where you're able to heal more than your contested health needs to be taken out (which would nerf the AOE weapons slightly), but other than that I feel that most weapons could use at least a small buff (especially melee). Melee weapons are pretty mid with most being used sparsely when you don't have/need ammo.

More GOOD Operation Variety - Many of the operations (specifically ones involving chaos) have gimmics that make them less fun. More missions that end with cool bosses or large set pieces where we are joined by multiple friendly vehicles would be preferred over hitting color combos to kill a helldrake.

With all this being said, the game is still awesome and a definite buy!!!",Recommended,1577,91.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 is a brutal, action-packed gore fest with a co-op mode that will leave you craving more.

Stunning visuals, from the environments to the visceral detail in combat.

Warhammer 40k Enthusiast: 7/10
Action/shooter enthusiast: 10/10
Layman outsider: 6/10

As a major 40k fan that plays most of the games they release including tabletop iterations. I love the franchise, and this one NAILS the FEEL of the 40k setting better than almost any recent game. The tyranids are really good enemies and provide a lot of good challenge. It seems to me at least on the lower difficulties that i have completed that the thousand sons are actually easier to bring down ? I'm not sure if this is the effect of access to better weapons near the same time that they become a antagonist or if they are just weaker on whole. i like the general idea of the parry system and i really feel great when im in the zone, the main problem i see is it is awfully hit or miss, there are times where the timing seems perfect and in fact it triggers perfect parry passives, but you still get staggered and take damage afterwards. I like that they force you in PvE to mix in your pistol gun-play into melee and you feel genuinely in danger when you run out of ammo on your sidearm on a melee class. Its a great tough punishing game that keeps you white knuckle and enjoying the action the whole playtime.

The main gripes i have are as follows:
A little fast and loose with the lore, although a location like ""the immaterium"" ""can"" look similar to your current physical location there is generally a reflection of the emotions experienced and most of the immaterium is basically roiling psychic radiation that would kill you instantly, a little better explaination of that last segment like that the changer of ways was keeping it habitable for the sorcerer and Marneus, but its most likely Tzeentch would have instead just betrayed his sorcerer for the opportunity to kill Calgar and not helped.

The weapons don't fit: If you are a big 40k fan the weapons are gonna feel off what you expect and the only one i feel is fair for that is for the thunder hammer to act the way it does because thats what it acted like in SM1. generally in Warhammer you are always trading something for something else when accessing weapons on the same tier. if you look at actual wh40k properties on the scale of swarm to heavily armored targets it should look like this:
Chainsword -> power sword -> Power Axe(offensive)/mace(Defensive) -> thunder hammer -> Power Fist
what seems to happen in the game is that the chainsword is weak, the power sword feels like an objectively better upgrade especially in the heavy wreath mode, the powerfist has more AOE and the thunderhammer has the most aoe .... Thankfully unlike other titles in the Genre that beef balanced weapon options the firearms you can equip generally cover your weaknesses or allow you to excel at specific targets. the best way i can describe it is that there isn't a ""melee weapon made for elites +"" the chainsword is bad at almost every encounter, the power sword has more aoe than the chainsword as well as more damage and penetration. The thunder hammer trades some speed for even better AoE but it drops off as a single target killer, the power fist seems to be a midrange between the sword and thunder hammer, it provides a cone like striking area and good penetration and damage (well rounded?) if you are having trouble with elite enemies transition to plasma pistol or incinerator and weave in charged shots while fighting elites, it does the job the power fist should.

The ""block"" trait outside its interaction with the Bulwark seems like an objectively worse trait and so far has never been worth the trade off of losing parry.

Assault needs more mobility in Co-op PvE

Power sword and plasma pistol should probably be accessible by all classes that have a main melee weapon (Not devastator/Heavy)

Chainsword needs some kind of buff when fighting non armored enemies to make it the minion mulching monster it should be.

The ravener, the lictor and the whip tyranid's red reveals do not accurately represent the window you have to dodge in all three can also very easily animation lock you on a single missed parry and basically take off 80% health or more, without you being able to evade, block or parry after getting hit once, you just take the next 3-4 hits with no agency (Not talking about the quick time events).",Recommended,3547,22.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

It's a defend this, go here, save these guys, then defend here. its very repetitive. I'm about 10 hours in and I'm playing on the hardest difficulty. I just reached CARNIFEX. It's a boss that uses melee and like green poison darts.

The boss will hit you even if its not hitting you. I've noticed that with other creatures as well. It'll swing you'll be 10 feet away and take damage. The guns are pretty boring nothing special for being a big alien type game. The HORDE clips you're seeing on social media are very underwhelming.

The combat is VERY boring and repetitive. Swing sword, Hold down attack, swing sword harder. Guns feel useless against anything bigger than the common default creature and will cost you all you're bullets (maybe just seems useless on my difficulty setting)

A few items that would have elevated the score for me: Don't reset my loadout mid-mission.

bobtheninjahobo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bobtheninjahobo/,"a 5/10 game that got overhyped by the ANTI-WOKES to an 8/10, possibly a 6.5/10 in it's current state with gameplay adjustments to make the frustrating mechanics lessened. people saying this feels like a 2010's shooter are so right for the wrong reasons LOL.

campaign is nice junkfood, has nice 40k shlock but is fairly short. not a whole lot of variety but it gets the job done and is pretty fun. played on angel of death and didn't have too much trouble getting through it.

operations are a decent coop mode that do not have enough content. fairly satisfying PVE combat backed by a frustrating health/armor system and a satisfying but boring parrying/execution system that doesn't work that well with a cooperative experience. the progression system takes forever but has no meaningful branching, build variety, or decision making other than picking the best weapon class (Melta ofc) and perks. ranged weapons are way better than melee at everything (sustaining health, damage output, avoiding boring combat systems, etc.), the most obvious example being the ass-ault class in PVE which has a gimped jump pack and underwhelming damage compared to the other classes (the other melee focused class such as bulwark have other abilities that make up for it). people touting the customization options are on mega copium, it's pretty much recoloring and barely any armor variety at the end game. matchmaking is absolutely terrible. a lot of the other issues that people have with operations (low ammo, ranged damage) get completely nullified with class perks/upgrades; the higher difficulties are tailored more for class upgrades/perks rather than skill (seems completely backwards). difficulties just make enemies spongier rather than more abundant or aggressive or faster (boriiiinggggg). overall operations at first glance a deep coop experience but when you dig into it progression is extremely shallow/boring, there is one 'right' way to do combat (melta/ranged spam or learn how to parry and gun strike to sustain), and very low mission variety.

PVP / eternal war is pretty fun. can't really say anything too much about it because i didn't spend much time in it but if I ever do I will update this portion.",Recommended,1853,83.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

ProVACcine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ProVACcine/,"Disclaimer: Only 10hrs in and came out almost a week ago, here is news from the from Front as the Xenos relentlessly continues to barrage the worlds that our glorious emperor bestows with us for great service.
I will continue to put more hours in towards PvE after I finish the Campaign.
As for the PvP I was playing a lot of it, the combat perspective is as always - an arcade shooter, decent pace with 5 - 10 minute matches. However being a player that is always looks forward to a good PvP game, this isn't it as of now or for good.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review for PvE/Campaign:
As always this team nailed the storyline, despite it being somewhat short and leaves in a insane cliffhanger. It's worth buy imo to support the devs. Same thing with the PvE, the PvE aspect of this game called ""Operations"" delves into the side story of the other Ultramarines that assist Titus in the campaign against the Xenos and how they helped you during the main campaign. That's pretty cool, you get to learn what they encounter to complete the mission, it is apart of the campaign as side missions. Also the scenery is mesmerizing!

Despite a short story and 6 missions to play in Operations, the devs are going to continue this marvelous story.
9/10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review for PvP: This games pvp felt like a game that was made by EA and unfinished. It does have it's aspects of an old school pvp shooter but the clunkiness and the awful hit reg. would have you question yourself is this a ""Skill Issue"" or ""Does my PC and/or Internet blow"".

Well no it's not a skill issue unless you have tracking issues/poor reflexes to land shots on your target. No, even a good player that comes from a handful of shooters such as myself and friends. We came to conclusion that this game has awful hit scanning, shots won't register majority of the time and the sniper reticles do not match your shots, both moving and standing still.

The PvP in this game can be good with better optimizations and registry, even getting a headshot with a sniper is unrewarding with how inconsistent it is, you're better off playing a Heavy or the Melee Classes to play this game.

4/10 - You're better off waiting for the patches to clear up the cesspool PvP has become. I see why people praise the PvE of this game, because PvP is extemely wonky.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will still recommend this game for the PvE and Campaign but for PvP, a definitive F no.

dresdenstl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dresdenstl/,"This is my first real foray into the 40k universe and I was not disappointed. It's just an all around excellent third person shooter. The campaign can be played in co-op or alone, though I have to say the AI companions are not the greatest. They're adequate enough for me to beat the second highest difficulty but they're weirdly unaggressive, making the player do most of the work and they RARELY ever use their special abilities.

Then there's two more modes. A co-op only campaign that takes place adjacent to Titus' story. You can pick one of six classes that get more upgrades the more EXP you get. This mode is a lot of fun.

Lastly there's the team deathmatch modes. They're okay. I haven't played much of them yet.",Recommended,595,46.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

its light on multyplayer maps as there are only 3 but the design of those maps is varied in sucha a way that engagments on the diffrent modes do play out semi diffrently. and they have a nice imersive feel too them and great design ewith flan,king routs and multiple ways to engage your enemy but not feel like there is no cover. like one the interior is foggy and hard to see but the outside is fine, so you get to fight in a foggy building and a jungle, then one is in the ruins with a library and caves so diffrent envirments there too, reminds me of old COD maps where you could fight a guy inside a mansion or out in the forest area its surrounded by. the only bad thing is although the game has a great layout and an amazing customizeation system with unlockable armour pieces that show your time and skill in the game as you unlock them with sucesfull missions or multyplayer wins, it dose put alot of colors behind a DLC pay wall and that ♥♥♥♥ sucks cause day 1 DLC plus no pink or purple without forkin over extra cash. the positive is there is a ton of ultramarine sucesssor chapter colors and you can get all the normal loyal space marines without forkin over cash excet grey knights, but then you can have crimson fists cause that dark navy blue is DLC sucks for people who wanted to be there own space marine chapter too as your limited slightly as no pink or purple still get a good range of colors but your creative potential is split by DLC.",Recommended,1780,33.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

pros :

- immersion (map quality is amazing.)

- story, which includes a GOOD co-op campaign (Thank god because these are hard to come by and I have been waiting for one for a long time)

- Combat (awesome execution animations, I wish there were more but i'll take what I can get...)

- Customization of armor, skins, etc.

Cons :

- Progression does seem a bit shallow, all there is to unlock it seems is weapons and armor (however I would much rather that than the game being a total chore like a-lot of games today).

- quantity of executions (the combat CAN get a bit repetitive at times and I think more animations would fix that considering how immersive they are.)

- some bugs when it comes to co-op and multiplayer and connections dropping (I'm sure these will get fixed though).

At the end of the day this game is just FUN, no predatory micro-transactions, no political bulls#$%. It truly feels like a game the developers enjoyed creating and they didn't have to rely JUST on marketing lies to get our money.",Recommended,970,25.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

BossJuiceHavinADeuce,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BossJuiceHavinADeuce/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a product of a former decade. It is filled with the same energy as Gear of War, the Bungie Halo Games, and the original Space Marine title for which this succeeds.

Non-stop high impact action, coupled with top-notch voice-acting (even slipping the storied voice of Johnathon Keeble into the background cast) and a unified vision with Games-Workshop lends this title to being pure in purpose, and devoid of the usual political confluence with D.E.I. (Sweet Baby, Inc., etc.) consulting firms that takes a good idea, and turns it into a bad one.

No, Space Marine 2 is nothing but a testosterone-filled epic that will run you roughly 8-12 hours of gameplay in the Campaign alone, followed by dozens of hours of multiplayer content to unlock and pimp out your Space Marine in your favorite Chapter (or Legion's) colors. My only complaint is that the servers are a little unstable at the moment for multiplayer, though disabling Crossplay improves this stability remarkedly, and that there is not a lot of content to work with.

GeneralPacman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralPacman/,"A true masterpiece and the best W40K game I've played since the first DoW.

- Gameplay is simple yet action packed, keeps you filling with adrenaline from start to finish;
- Graphics are great and the level design is just jaw-dropping. During my gameplay sessions I was constantly stopping just to look around and enjoy the scenery. The scale of the world and the level of detail creates a lot of inmersion;
- The campaign, while a bit short, it's absolute cinema. Both the gameplay and the cutscenes offer a level of fanservice I haven't seen in quite a long time. Devs knew exactly what their audience wants.

MtAverest,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MtAverest/,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. I am now a 40K Convert.

-The campaign Is genius and a masterwork of craftsmanship.
-The Operations(PvE) are incredible and tie into the main story. Allowing you to parallel the efforts of the campaign from the other side of the battlefield. I enjoyed progressing this with a battle-brother.
-The Eternal War(PvP) has to be the worst thing I have ever played.

If you want really cool gear for 1 character play 30 or so missions. If you want that same gear but quicker play pvp; as games go quicker. But you need victories to get the gear. Here's where it all falls apart. In 40 matches I've seen victory only twice and others who have played since launch have never known victory. Could this be a skill issue? Ya probably, but when discussing this with more pvp inclined friends the consensus is ""Just get on a good team"".

In PvP there is no MMR or rating of any kind that can be seen. You are always placed on a random team that needs you when queuing up. Teams are not shuffled before matches and you will always remain on your team and your lobby between games. The trick is to Queue Solo (winning teams never have the space for squads). Get on a team with several higher level players (of which have all the more powerful weapons unlocked due to their levels) and then never leave that team and steam roll every match. This is a cascading effect as each player that joins the losing team will inevitably leave and a new player will join.

When playing with friends one of us is often kicked from the group in between matches. This causes some sort of bug where they are no longer able to be invited to our group. This will force a restart on that players client as they will no longer be able to join any game mode or group. If this happens to be your leader for the group the current lobby you are in will become as we call it ""Corrupted"". All players will need to fully restart their client. For one of our friends this is a death knell to game time as his game takes 15 to 20 minutes to boot up.

Eternal War is fun don't get me wrong. Getting a triple kill on a flank as heavy; supported by the tank class will always be a favorite memory of mine. I will still play it and join my friends in glorious combat for the Emperor. But I will be watching the patch notes every day praying for a change.

-Group lobbies by level 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 and so on
-Boost loss rewards with extra Exp and Money so we can keep up with the winners
-Shuffle groups between matches

TL;DR - This game is amazing and I highly recommend it for the campaign and operations alone but the PvP is structured so that you will not see any victories unless you are king of strategy or just really lucky.",Recommended,2226,33.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

76561198198146867,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198198146867/,"There's still some balance issues I think need to be resolved. Most of the bolt weapons feel very underpowered, melee isn't very rewarding as even trash mobs take an oddly high amount of hits to kill in higher difficulties. The health and armor system is just very punishing, I think executing majoris or higher enemies should restore some health. The lack of pickups in higher difficulties makes dealing with hordes a slog. The chaos faction of enemies can get quite unfun since they dont engage as often in melee, and TZAANGOR SHIELDS.

But when all is said and done, this game feels amazing to play, the campaign and multiplayer modes are quite fun especially with friends.",Recommended,562,30.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The campaign is short and the way the missions are broken up is a bit weird. For example, the final mission is just EXTREMELY long and should/could have easily been broken up into multiple parts. But this is a minor grip at best as the power fantasy and tight gameplay make it extremely fun.

The loading times are horrific. Running on modern hardware, well above the recommended specs, I often have to sit through significant loading screens even when playing solo.

The PvP matchmaking is quite a mess. Anytime I try and join with one or more friends in my party, we sit waiting for a match indefinitely. There are many potential ""fixes"" out there (such as making sure you clock is synced correctly) if you google the issue but none have worked for us so far.

Every time you cancel matchmaking in PvP mode (whether solo or otherwise), the game encounters some kind of error and kicks you all the way to the title screen meaning that you have to sit through yet another loading screen before you can even get back to the PvP interface and queue up another match. I just wanted to change classes and that becomes a 3-5 minute affair if I have to cancel matchmaking to do it.

-Fun Gameplay
-Cool Armor and Character Customization
-Good Perk System

Cons:
-Matchmaking sometimes breaks and you have to ""Return to Title Screen"" to fix it.
-Party creation with friends sometimes breaks and you have to restart the game to fix it.
-Lag is very dependent on the host.
-Points for getting new armor and paint colors is handed out in too small of quantities after completing a PvE operation that PvP optimal for being able to afford all the cosmetics, perks, and weapons you want.
-Not a lot of content currently.

The matchmaking and stability will hopefully get fixed overtime through multiple patches. Points rewards is a balance issue that could easily be fixed if the devs decide too, it's not in a bad state currently, but it could be better. The content in the game is fantastic, but it isn't a lot at launch with 6 operations, 10 story missions and 3 PvP maps.

Finn_the_Brony,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Finn_the_Brony/,"Fun, solid game. Isnt too long, but quality is high. Just a bunch of men doing men ♥♥♥♥. The most emotional you'll see a character is one thats enraged, or one that tweaks the corner of their lip to show a deep seated respect for a partner. Not much fluff, and doesnt over stay its welcome

Here are some warnings, if any of these are dealbreakers

Campaign is fairly short, maybe 15 hrs max. There is 2ndart coop content where you play Marines in different parts of missions that you played in campaign. There is PvP - time to kill is pretty fast and melee lacks depth (parrying doesnt carry over, no hitstun) - PvP focused around team positioning more than anything else. It is fun.

Enemy variety is kind of low. This ends up being fine more me, as I finished the game in 4 sittings anyways. There are some annyoing types of enemies, like the occasional flying dude with tons of health who also gives all enemies shield and aggression. That said, the flow of combat is good and the bosses are awesome.

Balance is questionalble. Some weapons are better than others. Medium difficulty is too easy, the next hardest difficulty might be too hard to be fun for more casual players who are solo. Cakewalk vs Punishing gameplay.

Its a campaign that teases more content (but has a very well tied up story) and half the game is live service, no p2w yet just expensive and pretty worthless cosmetics for now. I might not get it at full price unless youre either interested in multiple parts of the game or are a big warhammer fan.

Or if you like big, sweaty, stoic men building brotherhood and killing badass ♥♥♥♥. Very little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game, very tight experience overall. 8/10 for the campaign, PvP can get there for me with some balancing and melee reworks.

armsspaghetti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/armsspaghetti/,"Space Marine 2's greatest problem lies within it's lack of content. Which, although disappointing, is a good problem to have. This game only brings a sense of wanting more.

The campaign is simple to follow story wise and it's level design is fairly linear with enough minor garden paths to explore to give you sense of scale.

The game excels majorly in it's spectacle. Everything you do is painted with a backdrop of a planet under siege, a city fallen to an invasion or the mysteries of the warp. This game seeps 40k. If you want to imagine you are the front cover of a codex, then this game will provide.

The ""feel"" of the game is meaty. You KNOW you are an angel of death, mowing down xenos or bursting fleshy heads with your bolter. There is nothing more satisfying that finishing off an enemy with an execute or a well timed gun strike.

The coop content outside of the campaign is lacking which could create some cause for concern regarding longevity. I found myself rotating between 6 of the same maps over and over and while each encounter on these maps can vary, the lack of variety backdrop or objective wise can get a little tedious.

Despite that, there are currently 6 definitive classes to choose from and I find the limitation of 1 class per mission to be adequate especially given there are more classes than there are players to take to these missions. However, there is a clear meta given how shallow the playstyle of melee classes feel compared to their range counterparts.

I have not played as much pvp compared to pve but as with most pvp games, the emphasis on meta gaming is much stronger there and can easily sway either way whenever those metas and balancing occurs so I won't comment further.",Recommended,1420,66.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Kenokerestyle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kenokerestyle/,"Very good game, if you run it at 4K max details, it is a beautiful wallpaper generator :D

Gameplay wise, it is better than the first game. The story so far is awesome, finding yourself lost in some moments of endless hoards of dead meat :D At some point for example, my caracter was yelling ""we should be going inside"", ""we should stop wasting time outside"", ""they are too many"", ""we should get to cover""... and me?... casually listening to Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Volume Mix 1, and slicing and dicing and grinding and killing hundreds or probably thousands of tyranids, as I was literally surrounded by hundreds of them... until I realized that there was no end and I should probably get to the objective... lol... and when I saw a group of 20+ elites coming at me, I kind of changed my mood :)) Probably the game said ""ENOUGH, CONTINUE WITH YOUR STORYLINE, MARINE!""...

Graphics are awesome also, top tier I could say.
Optimization is ok, nothing bad, 40-60 fps at 4K max details on a 10700K, strix 3080 OC, 32gb ram and game installed on a samsung 2Tb pro m2 drive. Yes, you need to wait about 10 seconds to load shaders when you load the game (CPU running at 95% when shaders load, so probably if you have a slower CPU than mine, that's why it crashes), and also another 10-20 seconds when you quit the game (clearing cache probably).

In 2.2 hours so far, I had no crash, no fps drops, no shuttering or anything that would disturb the gameplay.

The bad part? EPIC software, which I don't like. But, there is no big problem to say... at first when you start the game, it installs EPIC ♥♥♥♥ software. Then you go to main menu, settings, and you deactivate crossplay (nobody wants to play with epic / ps plebs). Then exit the game, uninstall all epic ♥♥♥♥, and start the game again. It will tell you that you need epic in order to use crossplay, but just click OK and ignore it. The game runs fine without the Epic ♥♥♥♥.

You can play the campaign on various difficulties, as single player or co-op. Also there are other missions plus PvP part.

I bought the 100$ version to support the game, and so far there's nothing bad to say about it. Yes, probably the grind will get repetitive, but again, I'm a guy with +3000 hours in Hunt showdown who prestige every time (full equipment reset), and totally ignore the availability of weapons, since the PvP gameplay is worth it (70 times so far).

Would've been nice to have a longer campaign for a 60$ game that people waited for 10 years, but what can we do...

The PVE and PVP grind is a bit rough though. Especially PVE where you need to colored chips in each map.
If you don't find them you can't upgrade your weapons, as there's no other way to get these chips, which is seriously annoying.

The limited classes (limited to 2 per in pvp and 1 each pve) is pretty annoying too.
Make Tac-Marines 3x on PVP and in PVE just let people be the class they hecking want.

Performance is wonky, at times my frames collapse on themselves, then it feels like i'm playing on console and then suddenly 2-3 matches later, everything's fine again.
Sometimes I get ~10 more frames in PVE than PVP/campaign, which doesn't make sense to me, as there's much less to render in PVP.

Nevertheless, I highly recommend the game. It's a lot of fun, weapons feel beefy (even the pistols).

The rest seem to be about how the reviewers don't have any friends, or the game isn't exactly the way they wanted it to be made, and therefore bad overall because it should have been made the way they personally prefer most. It's easy to see why they lack friends.

Top notch campaign, additional post-campaign content that doesn't feel like some obligatory grind but rather a fun add-on to the campaign you can do with friends, great PvP content, cosmetics that aren't an egregious cash grab, fantastic graphics, and minimal bugs/crashes really smooth out the experience",Recommended,655,24.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Crashing, bugs affecting the parry and aiming and it was super laggy. After the first update however the game was overall way better. Like most games it struggled at the very beginning.

Campaign: Now that I have put roughly 30 hours into this game (usually when I start to lose interest in story games) I find myself still excited to open up this game. The story overall feels good and not so rushed. (I have no prior knowledge of lore or other games) The characters and enemies are fun and refreshing. I have now played the full campaign 3 separate times with a few different buddies and still find myself enjoying each play through. I love the need for some sort of specific load out depending on what enemy you're facing.

Operations: I love the ops game mode. As I found out very quickly that playing only the heavy option may not be good for every operation. I like that every op has a different difficulty (Which actually seems to mean something in this game) and that the replay value is insane. It's refreshing that I can choose either co-op or single player for the ops.

Multiplayer: The multiplayer option is fun. There are people that definitely have way to much time on their hands (Like most games now adays) If there is a skill based matched making function in this game, it does not work very well. I consistently find myself going up against someone who is 5-10 levels higher than me. I have played roughly around 40 matches and have only won twice. I will say that all of the guns feel balanced depending on class that you play. For example, if I have a sniper and someone else has a sniper it comes down to who is the better shot.

Overall: Overall I love this game and see myself playing it for the foreseeable future. Highly recommend for anyone who just wants to hack and slash.",Recommended,1523,34.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

carpunch,https://steamcommunity.com/id/carpunch/,"I honestly am very mixed on this game. When it's working right, it's so fun... but when it's not... it can be the worst game I've played.

Campaign: Great
PVP: NOPE
PVE: MIXED

Story: Decent
Graphics: Great
UI: :Adequate
Stability: Mixed
Gameplay: Inefficient
Price (60): Maybe worth
Price (90): Not Worth
Price (100): Laughable

I'll start with the good.

So the campaign is well balanced and fun. It's about 12-15 hours depending on your mileage. The bigger issues show up when you get to the PVE. This is because the gameplay during the campaign is heavily curated to the story and does not rely on any timers/horde type mechanics to create difficulty. I very much feel this is the best version of the game, and provides a great experience for what the game can be. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and you can invite others to join you in this campaign, it is not required to be solo, once you get back to the lobby. If this is what you are here for, stick with the $60 version as there is no real customization options for your marines in the campaign.

PVP? I can't say much about that, I've seen it, not really interested in it. Looks fairly unbalanced with only a few classes actually being worth playing. Assault might actually be worth playing in this mode.

PVE? OH BOY... So here we go. This is the mode where the prior campaign balance dies. When you play difficulties Easy to Average you can actually see sections that highlight just how fun this game CAN be. However, from Average to Ruthless, there are increasingly more opportunities for you to see how much this game CAN'T work.

First, the parry system is not a bad idea, when one on one, handling an elite, a boss or even a random special unit like a lictor, the game can feel incredible. Parry this attack, reply with a gunshot, perfect dodge another, and heavy attack back, pushing back the smaller foes and staggering the elite. The execution ending the fight in a glorious spew of limbs and viscera. Unfortunately, if you take this same scenario and add the normal 6-8 extra elites with the hordes of tiny Xenos running around, you get to see how much it doesn't work. You parry one elite while another attacks just a half second after and you will parry one, and get hit by the second as you can't get both parries to work. Then you get hit by the unblockable attack from another one with a whip, get staggered by the gun shots from the one in the distance as you hold for a heavy attack to try to clear room. Now you have no armor, half hp, a full bar of white hp (reclaimable), and still a buttload of enemies trying to murder you. So you do your best sonic the hedgehog rolling around while attempting to clear an opening, and deal with the elites. Eventually you manage to either survive or more likely go down and get rez'ed (if emperor is willing) by one of the incompetent AI.

Issues with combat? The repose gun shot, needs I FRAMES! It feels like crap to get a perfect parry that you can't get off because you are being staggered to death by a 8 elites. The gunshot has a literal animation zoom that decreases your surrounding awareness to other attacks, making it impossible to defend when taking advantage of this mechanic. Also, if you are actively engaging in a parry with one enemy, the devs should not force you to complete the first parry animation before being able to perform a second, because of this, the group will interrupt that animation set, as you can't parry twice in a row in the quick succession. Now imagine this whole time, for any of these issues, that you are being pelted with rounds that both strip your armor, create barbs on the ground that deal damage, slow you, and prevent you from being able to see when the buildup is too great. Not to mention the swarm of enemies that do and can surround you while you are fighting, that will continue to shred your armor and hp, while you try to parry, and fire back. Trying to get a shot off from within a horde to stop ranged enemies is a death sentence. The game cannot handle the imbalance of events such as lowering the bombs and hordes being generated during the event. The special type enemies like the lictor or Zoanthropes, are fairly balanced as individual enemies go and work. However, it's about the timing or some of these spawns that can just End your run, such as if you get two Zoanthropes passing a shield back and forth while being a mostly melee character. Which the game is encouraging you to do, because you HAVE to get executions off to keep or get back your armor. The armor gets shredded so quickly you feel more like a tin can marine than one that is wearing 1.5k kilograms of a thick hardened ceramic plating.


When playing with others, sometimes the issues of being curb stomped lessen, because the enemy AI will actively ignore the other AI teammates you have. Sometimes having entire swarms just trying to kill the only players in the group. It is absurd that it is far more efficient to sonic the hedgehog your way through a level than to stop and fight the enemies. A space marine should feel powerful, and they don't. They feel heavy, they feel like they can hit, but they certainly can't take one. With how few Astartes exist, this makes me think it's because they keep wearing the best in paper mâché.

Anyways, I really like this game, and I haven't even touched on the crap ammo amounts at higher difficulties. This is likely to encourage the melee, but you can't do this, because of the amount of enemies and the previously mentioned issues I mentioned with melee combat.

The game has great bones, and is extremely fun when it works, but when it doesn't. It is PAINFULLY bad. HD2 is not in a great place, but the devs might turn that around here... still It is not a HD2 killer, and was supposed to be a different kind of game. I didn't think I would feel as squishy as a HD though as a Space Marine.

Currently I recommend the game, but If they can't figure out how to prioritize the mass combat, it won't even keep up with games like Darktide of Vermintide 2 soon.

As for stability, the game spins up extreme resources and hangs up when it is closing. I have to force close it every time. I have never had it successfully close.

Amazing graphics, gameplay loop is pure unadulterated fun, snappy combat and enough customization to truly make your dream angel of death. Even though the amount of content is fairly lacking for now at launch spanning a 7-8 hour campaign which is pretty good, Lieutenant Titus' return was a very welcome addition to 2024. 6 PvE missions spanning 4 difficulties. 3 PvP Modes with 3 maps which is surprisingly fun for a game that i didn't expect PvP content from at all.

Overall a solid 9/10, will be a 10/10 when more content drops and the horde mode gets added.

Highly recommended.

WedgerNuts,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WedgerNuts/,"Absolutely!

Space Marine 2 is the long anticipated sequel to the very first game, which was not only memorable due to being amongst the first of couple of Warhammer 40k titles going into a more modernized video game genre, it was also great to play in it´s own right.

This game although as beaten the quality and gameplay smoothness of the first one by miles.

It is fun, gory, high stakes and intense, once you get to the PvE and PvP gamemodes you get a very nice mantle of options to try, with PvE really allowing you to sink your teeth and time to leveling up the respective classes with specific abilities to synergy with your time, as well individually choosing which variants of weapons you play with.

PvP is suprisingly fun and in-depth, although we are yet to see the Heretics gain proper customization choices, but the classes behave uniquely in this new player vs player enviorment!

Can´t wait for further content drops, as I am excitingly awating this to be a Live Service experience right up my alley.

I demand to be allowed to upgrade to the season pass or to be able to invidually buy the chapter specific cosmetic packs, to lessen the cost.

This game looks amazing, the scale and presentation feels on top at most parts. Then there are parts, mostly gameplay mechanics, which feel like total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Shoot your enemys with mini rockets which explode on the inside but only do enough damage to an enemy, when you headshot them. It is really frustrating, when you shoot half your ammo into a Termagant and it still walks, because you did not hit its heads....and that is on easy. Most weapons feel useless, even after sometime. Close combat gives me no pleasure like in the first game, although you have some really nice finishers. You get swarmed nearly any second in the game and have little to no time to really concentrate on your objective or take in the scenerey. You are under permanent pressure where you can hardly aim, have to consider and react to parry or dodge situations (which are almost constant and you fail almost constantly), all this while you have little means to counter hordes, stun your enemys effectively or do a conisderable amount of damage to your enemys in ranged or close combat.

I have played one round of PVP up to this point and it was more fun than playing through the entire campaign and PVE content.
In conclusion I think that this game is a lot work but gives little joy or fun in return, because at least for me, it just gave me a lot of frustration. Playing with a friend was fun, but did not really help to ease the pain. I don´t claim to be the best gamer there is and maybe I don´t really get the mechanics the way they should be used, but right now, at least for me, it does not feel good and rewarding, the way it should feel. I really hope they reconsider and change some mechanics so that PVE can be fun in the future.",Recommended,1464,20.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

76561198122410358,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122410358/,"Let's be clear, the game is absolutely not perfect especially in terms of overall balancing, netcode, and actual clear explanation of most mechanics. It's also a spectacular experience that doesn't play like anything else, putting you in an amazing rush even with its jank. TL;DR, the game does a lot of things right, but nothing *perfect* which can make it feel dragged down or missed potential, trying to cover a wide umbrella of modes instead of focusing.

This game differs from Space Marine in that you no longer gain health on executions, instead mostly gaining armor (acts as a Halo shield) or whatever perks your co op class has. It also bites the bullet and makes your character invincible, instead of before where you could very much still die doing any of them. This ends up creating weird problems in the harder parts of the game. In Space Marine 1, you spent a lot of time poking out in a cover shooter without a cover system and quickly eating bullets and dying. In this game, you want to constantly be up in the fray to regain armor to live even one more hit, but you'll have so many indicators and so many attacks to try blocking that you're going to eat a ton of unnecessary damage and likely die anyways if you're even thinking about using your non-heavy melee attacks.

The game is split into three modes: Campaign, Operations (Co-Op focused missions), and Eternal War (PvP).

Campaign is relatively short clocking in around 7 hours on normal assuming you're new to it. It has plenty of warhammer wanking and a good continuation of Titus's story with some new marine chemistry, but it gets a bit grating hearing their almost high-school drama tier dialogue until the final couple missions. There's a point halfway through where they just sound like kids arguing over nothing rather than war torn marines. The levels are still pretty standard defeat the waves until you can go on like the first game, but there's a few times where the objectives change and they're easily the worst parts gameplay wise because despite making an enemy system where you reaaally want to get out of the way of certain attacks, you have plenty of ""hold down this one area"" objectives which are basically death traps. The environments and sheer number of enemies is gorgeous though, something I think can't be matched for the foreseeable future. However, you'll notice that a lot of the changes to the gameplay (notably the weapon selection) is greatly neutered for the sake of the added join in Co-Op, which can make it feel more stale than it should because you'll just grab the Las Fusil or Melta Gun every single time you have it. The AI partners never change their weapons and they're incredibly stupid, sometimes barely firing at minor grunts. If they're trying to melee they act at the speed of a nursing home patient. It's genuinely shocking how long enemies take to kill in the campaign solo, and then you jump online and see the same enemies melt when actual sentient beings are firing at them.

Co-Op is the meat of the game, and probably where most people are reporting their issues with the gameplay overall.
A lot of the problem comes from the overall grind of levels for every co-op class. A lot of them just... feel awful without getting perks first. A couple of examples are Tactical and Sniper not seeming like much, but becoming the kingpins of the game once they're at a very high level after a lot of hours of playing them like garbage. Many of the classes are way more limited in weapon selection than they should, I see no reason everyone can't use the plasma pistol for example. Levels are long for how often you're expected to replay them, reaching about 20 minutes on average with a competent team but can go up to 30 or 40 depending. Unlike say, Helldivers, there's very little you can do to make it quicker due to the missions being tied to story so you usually have more than a few ""wait for x to happen"" moments. Progression is also unclear because the items needed to unlock new weapons called Armory Data is a completely random spawn. Weapons require so many kills to progress which is a huge problem with the extra terrible starter tier guns or the sniper rifles with low capacity. This is made worse by some weapons actually being insane at max level but feel so awful at base that you would never figure it out, like the Tactical's basic Bolt Rifle at max tier can reload several grenades in its grenade launcher and match damage with some of the hardest hitting weapons in the game... but you have to get there with the worst gun in the game before it gets to that point. Almost everything is like this, which is probably why you'll have a huge disparity between how much 200 hour players love the game and how much that people who only wanted the campaign will really not like the experience. It really should've had a starter lineup of perks to define the playstyle of the classes instead of needing to unlock all of them over the course of 20 hours each.

I bring up all of these negatives because I think the game feels incredible when you're blasting and slashing through a horde of enemies and knowing that you're good enough to get out of situations that are killing most players in the game. It keeps you on the backfoot almost every turn at high difficulty until you fully master the role you have. Sniper goes from being just that job to kill big enemies, to being the best class to take objectives and heal allies with its invisibility along with restoring ammo for a weapon that kills the most obnoxious enemies in the game at any range in a couple of shots. The absolute storm of blood as you're trying to save your friends from three dogpiles is a blast.

PvP is still something I have to get used to after spending almost all the time on operations, but from the 20 or so games I've played of it, it is hilariously unbalanced and for now its fun because of that, but later I can see it being really bad once people acclimate to just grouping up and death balling on enemy spawn zones. Annoyingly, this mode *also* has a separate progression, which is going to make the disparity between people with starter weapons and people with the bolt carbine and melta gun way worse as more people get on. Some classes also kinda just function differently. Vanguard with its grapple gun can now also grapple somewhat freely to most walls, and Assault with its Jump Pack can have 3 charges like the campaign. This scratches the head over why Assault feels so gimped in Operations where it has half the jump height and less charges for no reason.

The overall matching system is pretty dreadful. You have to guess whether or not you're joining matches because there's no kind of browser and you're leaving everything to chance on pressing the queue button, which sometimes breaks and doesn't even actually launch you. The after-game is similar to Helldivers where you're sent back to the hub area after a mission, which gets really annoying because most people will just leave to freely customize their stuff after leveling up and the resulting loading screens get so long and take up all of your time. If even this aspect gets touched up I would have a much more positive review.

Space Marine 2 reaches for a lot of things and it's still an incredibly fun and unique experience, but not everyone is going to love the confusing combat at first and I still can't fathom people saying SM1's cover shooting was somehow balanced better. The grind is atrocious for how cool the missions are to go through for your first times and for how fun the classes feel at high level. PvP is similar to the old days where it felt kinda tacked on. Other than that, I can at the very least say its a hell of a game even with so many rough eurojank edges. It's refreshing to have a game that doesn't just tell me to keep coming back daily and if you're sick of the co op, you can just say you're sick of the co op.",Recommended,6513,27.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The game is really fun with people but whatever you do, DO NOT RELY ON CPU ALLIES!!!

If they're snipers, they'll hide in the back. And for the others, they'll sit there and not one-hit-kill enemies when the prompt is up for it and you'll need to kill them before they wake up and call on more enemies to come. Get some friends for the PVE cause it will stress you out throughout the game. I'm on PC and sometimes it will have you searching for a lobby for way too long.

I am relatively new to 40k, having my entire knowledge about it from short lore videos and memes. So when I see a game that isn't just some random smugs thrown into a mission to go die (like Darktide) I instantly got it, and I am glad I did. The space marines feel heavy, his weapons powerful... until you face off against the bigger foes and realise that even though you have a weapon which vaporizes a normal human you still not the strongest guy in the entire area.

So lets get the only real negative I have noticed here out of the way first, its not really that bad as it could just be my personal taste:

The size of battles, specifically the amount of imperial guards thrown at the enemy. Everywhere I read about the imperial guard its millions of bodies thrown at the enemy to go soak up their ammo. Here its like... 40? At most? I understand that you can't add that many due to PC requirements but that was one thing that stood out for me.

If you are a 40k fan buy it, if you are new to the series still get it. The campaign alone is already worth it to me AND THE FINAL FEW MISSIONs OOOOOOOOOOH BOY. YES YES SO MUCH YES!

Haven't had many issues regarding performance save a few visual bugs. Multiplayer while fun has some issues that'll make or break the game in the long term. Solid campaign though it is a tad short.

Dev needs to fix class system and matchmaking quickly or people going to drop it soon. Half the time I can find a squad full squad for operations you end up with a class conflict and people drop. Allowing two of any class would solve so many issues.

The difficulty scaling could be done better with more enemies and high threat enemies at higher difficulties instead standard ""major"" enemies just become damage soaks you wail on. A regular Tyranid warrior eating an entire mag from a Metlagun is kind of annoying. This more or less chains into what classes and weapons you can use making the previously stated issue of class conflicts even worse.",Recommended,773,45.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

sterilemoleman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sterilemoleman/,"a phenomenal game for people that like to get knocked around a bit, learn, and master a challenging game with rewarding unpredictability. it's darktide combined with elden ring and doom eternal, with a thick layer of delightful lore and gore.

the ""operations"" mode is the beautiful core experience. 3 player coop to survive traversing a map with various objectives and waves of attack. the darktide / left4dead experience we all know and love, a wide variety of enemy types across 2 factions, surprise boss fights randomly overlapping huge waves of enemies for disastrous effect. each class has a 1 to 25 level crawl but after level 10 you have a full talent build. weapons are leveled or instantly mastered at a cheap cost.

the campaign's real cool but not worth the price alone. the PVP mode is nice to have, and works better than you'd expect, but it feels a bit tacked on and probably won't be the selling point for people. i wish they'd lean into the satire and comic flaws of the empire a bit more, personally, but it's bad for marketing.

early tips:
- tiers of difficulty are relative to your level and item strength, so just know you'll get stronger as you go and it'll start to feel a bit more fair. particularly when leaning into certain talents.
- google a discord for the game. you rely on players a lot and if you're 2 people it is bugged to matchmake a third. you can drop a ""join code 6digits, class1/class2 reserved"" statement in a channel and instantly get a strong player or two to join in 2 seconds.
- attack to heal HP bar, avoid staggers that prevent doing so.
- there are three parry styles for melee weapons: block, balanced, fencing. know what they are and test.
- remember to stretch and bring a towel for the sweat.",Recommended,1439,50.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

-Fun endgame content
-Epic graphics
-Great Astartes customisation

Cons:

-Lack of Terminator Armours. :P
-Many loading screens that often lag or freeze the game
-Ping spikes during online matches
-Cannot choose to play as a Chaos Marine whenever I want
-No Chaos Marine customisation (especially the Thousand Sons that we cannot play as, who are featured in the campaign)
-The story is very nice but a bit short for a 60-100 euro game
-Requisition Points farming is tedious

Music is good, Operations is fun, and the campaign doesn't overstay it's welcome. Finished on the second highest difficulty and took around 10 - 11 hours.

Pros:
The plot and fan service are top notch. The game's scripted cutscenes and cinematics are simply epic.
Cons:
When you start fighting yourself, the game turns into a low-quality copy of Dark Souls. The balance is just a joke, you only need a multi-melta, a plasma pistol and a power sword. The combat simply turns into constant rolling and shooting from a melta at large enemies, and finishing off small ones either sets you up or is completely impossible because they die before your current animation ends to start the finishing animation. Often, parries and counterattacks simply don't count, which ruins the already poor gameplay. What they did with the engine is also cool.

That is my only complaint, everything else is wonderful.",Recommended,428,10.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 15
AllusiveAllusion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AllusiveAllusion/,"Space Marine 2 reminds me of great shooters from the 2000s and the early twenty-teens. Games like early Call of Duty's, Kill Zone, Halo, and Gears of War. Shooters that had the just the right amount of action and variety to be very enjoyable for their run time. As well as having stories that range from good to great. I would like to call attention to the mention of ""their run time."" This to me is a very key part of this. Space Marine 2, and the games I mentioned that it reminds me of, are all relatively short games when comparing them to a lot of modern day games. Which have run times that call well exceed fifty hours. While long run times are not necessarily a bad thing. I have found that shorter games have their place. Especially for people who do not have the time to finish a hundred plus hour epic anymore. I also believe that if Space Marine 2 was any longer then its ten to fifteen hour runtime it would start to become monotonous. It ends right as the enemy variety and mechanics are coming to the end of their ability to engage me. Perfectly timed!

However, that isn't to say once you finish the ten to fifteen hour main campaign that you uninstall this game and not think about it for two years until you think it may be fun to go back and experience it before the sequel comes out. It also comes shipped with both a Co-op PvE mode and a 5v5 PvP mode. Which again, reminds me of the fully fleshed out games of the past. These two modes offer quite a bit of variety and are pretty dang fun.

The PvE mode has you following a secondary group of space marines that run different missions that Titus (The main character) orders to have done during the main campaign. Which is a cool concept for these PvE missions. These missions follow a formula similar to that of Darktide's gameplay. You march to an objective taking out large groups of enemies and the occasional elite enemy or boss, then complete that objective. It works in Darktide and it works here! However, I would not think of the PvE mode as a Darktide clone, but it has the same type of ""feel"". Which is again a good thing if you like the tide games. I will say however, there are, at the time of writing this review, only six of these missions and the objective variety and enemy variety due become kind of stale after a few hours of gameplay. But I would assume this is going to get some post launch support that will address these issues. At least I would hope....looking at you FatShark. Overall the PvE mode is a good way to extend your time with the game. Especially, if you have a couple of friends to help you purge the filthy xenos.

Now the PvP mode I believe is the weakest part of this game. That's not to say it's bad. But I will say parts of this game are good or even great, While I would classify the PvP as, serviceable. It's a fairly standard 5v5 arena style third-person shooter with the game modes that you have come to expect out of the base rotation from the likes of Call of Duty. It has the same class structure as the Operations mode, were you have to level up each class to get access to it's other weapons and cosmetics. Again, very standard stuff here. What I feel is the most rough part of the PvP, is that some of the classes just feel way to good, or I guess you could take the stance that the other classes feel bad. I assume this will also receive some post launch balance. But even still I feel this games strong suits are in the PvE modes and will always be.

To finish this up, I think Space Marine 2 is an excellent game that is well worth your money. It's a return to what feels like games from the past, fully fleshed out experiences that don't prattle on for way too long and while anecdotal, I did not experience any noticeable bugs while playing. So if you enjoy the 40k universe, would like to purge xenos a heretics alike as an angel of death in service to the holy emperor of man kind, and would like to support the idea that all games should release like this, pick it up!",Recommended,3242,18.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

I enjoy the gore, gameplay, actions.

What I would change is
Uselessness of the BLOCK function
Matchmaking - smooth it out, easier to interact. Queue up with a group who is not your selected class
Polish the game so it closes easier, does not murder your GPU
Feature to where every checkpoint in the match allows you to keep what you pickup in case of disconnecting(Granted thi will be abused)",Recommended,349,27.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

kamuragi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kamuragi/,"Having delved deeply into Space Marine 2, it’s safe to say this game is a triumphant return to the Warhammer 40K universe, bringing with it everything that made the original great while enhancing the experience with stunning graphics, brutal combat, and an intense sense of scale.

From the first moment I dropped into the game, the sheer weight and power of being a Space Marine is palpable. Playing as a hulking warrior of the Imperium, the action is visceral, with every bolt round, chainsword swing, and explosive encounter delivering a brutal, tactile punch. The combat mechanics shine, maintaining that perfect blend of ranged and melee combat that keeps the adrenaline flowing. Whether I’m mowing down hordes of Tyranids with a bolter or hacking them apart with a power sword, every encounter feels cinematic and intense.

The enemies themselves—primarily the Tyranid horde—are terrifyingly relentless. The AI is smart, and their swarm tactics push me to adapt constantly. It creates an atmosphere where every battle feels like a desperate stand for survival, much like the lore of the Warhammer universe demands. The game's environments are vast and beautifully designed, evoking the grimdark aesthetic of the 41st millennium, with gothic architecture towering over battle-ravaged landscapes.

One of the best aspects of Space Marine 2 is how it captures the essence of Warhammer 40K’s lore. Whether you're familiar with the universe or not, the game immerses you in the brutal world of eternal war. The voice acting, music, and sound design are exceptional, making every battle feel like a holy crusade in the name of the Emperor. As a fan of Warhammer 40K, the little lore touches—the chants, the prayers, and the fanatical zeal—are a delight.

Space Marine 2 nails the feeling of being a relentless superhuman warrior in one of the most dangerous universes ever created. For both veterans of the Warhammer franchise and newcomers alike, this game is a must-play. It’s not just a game—it’s an immersive experience where you are the Emperor’s might, purging heretics and xenos alike. For the Emperor!

Really enjoyed the entire campaign even though I have not played the previous installment. Personally the combat controls were difficult to adjust to however felt rewarding once I figured it out. A lot of reviews mention the missions in the campaign became repetitive, however in my opinion the cinematic between battles we're some of the coolest I've ever seen in a game which was more than enough for me to enjoy whatever came after. No characters felt like they didn't belong, and of course the voice acting was amazing. Overall I don't think the $60 price is too much at all. Really fun game with a great story.

Campaign is absolute perfection. Not too long but not too short either. Graphics are awesome. Once you have finished that you can move onto operations and on the easier difficulties doesn't require much team sync but once you get onto the hardest team sync is a lot more focused on. So much fun levelling up characters and trying out different weapon types. PVP took me by surprise. Can definitely see me putting in a fair few hours on operations and PVP. Game of the year contender atm for me. Reminds me of games of old. No microtransactions or having to pay extra for stuff that should have been in the game from the get go.

Trektroll,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trektroll/,"So. This is a review for the SP Story. I haven't touched anything else yet.

So, the game is good. Actually, it's great. The story is awesome, to the degree that I could not put down the game nearly. And I have issues with playing the same game for too long, in case I get bored and just don't open the game again.
But this game changed that. Quickly.

Voice Acting.
It was good, really good. Nothing extreme, but very Warhammer.

Facial Animations.
This is important to me, I enjoy seeing the emotions of those that I play as and with, it helps me get immersed in the story. And this was well done. But, one can only get some emotional expressions when it comes to Astartes.

Graphics.
Jfc. The Graphics are bonkers good. Even on Medium/High settings. I tried it on low as well and no matter what, the game looks incredible.

Story.
The story is Solid. Almost feels like 2 storylines at times. With Tyranids in one and the other with the Traitors. But it merges soon enough and the game becomes a great addition to the WH40K universe and for those that already loved the universe, the story will make you happy.

But.
The story is way too short for it's price.
The PvE extra content is only 6 missions as well.
I can see myself continue to play this solo when they fix the bots. Just grinding the operations to upgrade my classes. But I haven't touched that yet.

I dearly hope they add more to the Operations part of the game. Especially for the price.

But, I still recommend this for those that are unsure.",Recommended,1247,10.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

I do not like PvP (I burned myself out from Halo 2/3 PvP) but this is really refreshing and enjoyable. I do it when I want to kill some time without being dedicated to 45min of PvE.

bambam625,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bambam625/,"So I just finished the campaign. Very well made game, enjoyed the combat, and the attention to detail was fantastic (besides the fact that chaos doesnt have access to primaris , and theyre the same size as a primaris, where as normal astartes are actually smaller). I had one infinite loading screen during my whole playthrough and no issues besides. I run it on a 11700k, 32gb ram, and a 6800xt, and get over 60 fps stable with all the settings maxed out, at 1440p and after i swapped the game off of my boot drive and onto my spare optane ssd i didnt have any issues with the infinite loading screen deal.

If youre concerned: they stick to the lore, theres no woke/dei pandering bs. Its a pure 40k experience.

My only real complaint about the campaign is that mid mission they completely change your loadout for no reason. Like one second i have my plasma weapons and a hammer that i specifically chose as my loadout in the beginning of the mission, then im back to the default (beginning of game gear) after a cutscene during the same mission.

Ive only done one operation and found them fun, i plan to play them more and will update as I get more time with operations in.

harrizar177,https://steamcommunity.com/id/harrizar177/,"The game is okay if you want to enjoy it with your buddies but other then that for a solo player you got no chance in hell in completing the campaign on angels of death difficulty, i got as far to the core room fight and with so much going on and everything at your ankles its very hard to see any progress in this area of the campaign (unless if you drop the difficulty to Veteran which I won't do because im not stopping while i'm already ahead or get some buddies on with you which also is something thats a better rough for me to do so).

the operations mode is cool but when you play the second difficulty your more likely to see bosses which bare in mind would have made sense if at the later difficulty but oh well.

as for the multiplayer you can just about get all the armour peices you want just by grinding the multiplayer alone which also makes it the point that doing angels of death difficulty as a solo is just pointless.

as for bugs i think the game is very buggy on multiple occasions i was stuck by invisible walls made by random objects on the floor, every time you dodge in the carnifex fights it can still hit you even if you perform a dodge move, oh and a weird bug happens in the carnifex fight where your teammates don't notice your down so they just leave you to die....

this game is not made for solo players that want a challenge, its more built on coop which isn't a bad start for the games release but too many bugs are at play to allow solo players progress on the angel of death campaign.

The Bad: The connectivity. Good lord it is stone-age levels of terrible. I have yet to play a single game of multiplayer where I didn't disconnect in the victory screen, if not when trying to find teammates or mid-mission. And the disconnect on the victory screen wouldn't be so bad IF you got to keep your progression. If it disconnects at the wrong moment, or if you do anything in offline mode, your progress is gone. No exp for your character. And god help you if you purchased any cosmetics or upgrades, because not only will you not have those the next time you log in the in game currency you spent will still be gone. It's like your astartes got their power armor pocket picked. Many cosmetics also require you to win a certain number of games to unlock, BUT if you disconnect in the victory screen that counter doesn't go up. I've got a level 10 character who hasn't unlocked any of those cosmetics because every round disconnects.

The only way to reconnect is by restarting the game entirely. Doesn't matter at what point it loses connection. It claims you can reconnect from the title screen but that has not worked once.",Recommended,1206,25.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Frankly, I enjoy this game, quite a bit too. It reminds me of Helldivers 2 during its peak, but there are some issues that are honestly just a deal breaker for me.

(Note: I've only played a single operation, and a little bit of the campaign. I'll update this as opinions come up/change)
1. WTF is the combat. It feels like a horrid mix of Helldivers minus the stratagems, and Darksouls. It doesn't feel right, and it just feels clunky rather than awesome, which is what I should feel when I'm a SPACE MARINE.
2. On the topic of being a space marine, WHY AM I SO FREAKING WEAK??? I feel like no matter what I do, I never have enough ""health"" (if you can even call it that), and my armor always just gets melted. I know this could be called a skill issue, and it probably is, but I'm on normal difficulty, I'm not trying for a crazy hard experience, I just want to play the game, rather than have my bot teammate (who actually almost never dies, because only like 2-6 enemies actually target him) revive me every 30 seconds because my health gets melted in 5 inches thick of armor.
3. I don't like the movement very much. This is honestly a simple fix, the walking feels not right, I don't know how to explain it, but in-lore they move at 40mph (according to Reddit, take that with a grain of salt) but it feels like I'm moving slower than an NPC in a CoD campaign, furthermore the movement is just not reactive. To see what I mean you really have to look at some clips or play the game, but it just doesn't feel .
4. Why are my guns so weak? The bolt/plasma/melta guns are MASSIVE, so why does it take me 2 or more shots to neutralize a small or weaker enemy on normal difficulty? I honestly feel like this could be fixed with some balancing to make your guns feel strong, like they should be.

Overall, I don't really see a place for this game. It feels like its trying to live up to the ""Helldivers 2 but better"" but also like a Soulslike? With some simple balancing, and the ability to regen health outside of Medicae Stimms, which feel really rare when I'm constantly hovering at low health, would do wonders for this game. Until then?

The game play feels incredibly crunchy and hefty, the sound design supports the feeling of ""weightiness"", the recoil of the weapons is satisfying and the executions with melee weapons are brutal. The game also just looks beautiful and the attention to detail is top notch. Beyond all that, the developers of the game absolutely knew what they were doing with the setting, and have created missions and a story that is truly amazing and makes you feel like a complete bad ass.

Campaign 10/10 - bit short but its a fine wine
PvE 7/10 - may change due to future content
PvP 8.5/10 - Its PvP, fun, not much to say.

Campaign 10/10. On the short side, but the content and future updates will overshadow it.

Operations ( PvE multiplayer ). 7/10, However with the promised content and current plans from developers, it may be boosted to a 9/10. Game matchmaking is honestly just horrible, it will sometimes not work, sometimes you have to swap classes because someone else is already that, quick match does not offer extra rewards so theres no encouragement for people to hit it. Load times for joining and leaving. Terrible endeavor to join brothers in combat.

The netcode for the game is fair, however it seems for people with higher pings, dodging and certain actions are not favorable towards the player, this can be upsetting for some groups of friends, Otherwise the combat requires you to be a flow of the field, parrying, dodging, stunning, gun striking.

Class balance wise I feel its fair, a couple classes could use a bit of buff via the perk tree/passives for weapons, however ammo vs small enemies feels a bit weird at times, and it does create a struggle of relying on melee to save ammo for O crap moments. Personally im fine with this, but some people want a bit more dakka.

In harder content, regular boltors, carbines, feel underwhelming vs small enemies, against larger enemies it should probably also get a buff, but it just becomes too ammo innefficient with time compared to other weapons. They should re evaluate the damage and ammo pool to make it a better choice. Heavy weapons all feel great though.

PvP fun for goofiness, or whatever. Some things are OP, but the game is not meant to be a competitive PvP game.",Recommended,1485,56.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

8/10

It has a 6 hour campaign and another 4 hours of story missions that focus more on multiplayer.
The bossfights in the Single Player campaign were often confusing to me and rather overtuned or just a bullet sponge event.
Most campaigns have a couple big fights - and they are impressive with the sheer number of enemies - but they also have very long passages of walking and using elevators. There is a lot of stalling.

If you are a 40k fan I guess this carries the game to a 10/10. I think it's a decently crafted game. The gory finishers are fun, the weapons work - however it's also lacking in a lot of areas. Most range weapons are very much the same. To me there rarely was a ""flow"" state in which the game felt ""cool"" for minutes at a time. You either have your flow interrupted because you can't get an execute to refill your armor and you die or because the battle is over and its time for 2 elevators and 3 hallways.
The only innovative thing is the amount of enemies you have. The only unique thing about this shooter is the setting an the over the top visuals. The graphics overall are pretty impressive though a HD texture pack might be nice.

Multiplayer:
I only dabbled a little in the story missions which seem to be almost on par with the campaign - just no cutscenes. And I did some PVP.
Overall there are too many load screens in multiplayer. I don't know the technical side to this but I feel like I have to do 10 loadscreens to finally join a game. 4 at least. In PVP the graphics are heavily tuned down. HEAVILY.
The PVP surprisingly played quite nice and not unbalanced - but it's not really my cup of tea.
In the story missions it's quite easy to get lost or get confused what your team should do. But with a little improvement - and even as is - it can be a very fun mode to play with friends. With randoms it's not really that great.


Bugs:
I crashed a couple times during the campaign. Couldn't really tell what the issue was - game just froze at some points. Otherwise the game is pretty polished, the textures will load low res and then high res which reduced stutter to a minimum. The multiplayer servers were a little buggy at times.

Overall:
I can't really see this game being shooter of the century, I think there are other shooters that are better. But the multiplayer was more fun than Helldivers II for me - so that is a plus.
It definitely is a good game and if the developers keep developing it, then it has a lot more gametime than 10 hours of campaign.",Recommended,2064,14.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

76561198057990010,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057990010/,"Fun game with one of the best depictions of WH40K you'll see. Tells a better story than a lot of Hollywood movies. Fun overall gameplay but the game has some serious balance issues when you get out of campaign and into the pve operations. There's also some major matchmaking issues right now that will hopefully get better with time. Also the audio for gunshots and marine footsteps could do with being more ""meaty"". Let's get some bass, yall (overall sound design is great though).

Biggest problem for me is the balancing, where 2-3 classes and 1-2 guns (starts with ""m"" and ends with ""elta"") being VASTLY superior to any other choice with how the mechanics work for getting back health/armor. If you read this Saber, DO NOT make the same mistake that a lot of pve devs make and just nerf the viable things into the ground. Look at WHY everyone is using them (namely the survivability that they provide), and buff other things to make them viable as well. Do NOT nerf the melta into the ground right now because it will drive players away. General tip, every class needs ways of getting health back that isn't med packs. I honestly think that was a bad design choice, we should be constantly losing/getting health back in this game. But for a lot of the classes, you just do the ""losing health"" part.

Also game could just use more legs. The meat of this game for pve players like me is the operations and only having 6 missions is a detriment. The enemies are procedural so there is replay value but you can only do the same 6 missions so many times. There's also a lot of people just farming the first mission because it's the easiest. Tyranid and Chaos forces should be more balanced for that reason (everyone is going to farm the missions with the tyranids if they're objectively easier to fight for several reason e.g. Chaos Marines rarely melee, meaning they can rarely be parried, removing TWO of your most powerful tools in the combat flow, parries and gun strikes). Also the roadmap only shows ONE more map in the next year or more. I've already gotten 40-50 hours of fun outta these missions so it's been worth it for me but possibly not for others.

Overall great game but it's clear that they haven't ever balanced a pve coop game before because there's a lot of problems baked into the mechanics of the game that will never go away (but can hopefully be improved with time). That said, the gameplay itself is fun enough that a lot of people won't care and will still get a lot of fun outta this game. Would just be more fun if the game was better balanced and had a bit more content. 7/10 right now, 8.5/10 when they get the multiplayer issues more sorted, and 9.5/10 if they can somehow find some way to balance classes/weapons more (godspeed on that).",Recommended,2271,89.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

I picked this game up on the recommendation of many friends, and I had fun playing it, but I do not feel it is really worth $90CAD in this economy. You get much more for your dollar from other games.

djrob117,https://steamcommunity.com/id/djrob117/,"Campaign (Solo/Co-op): Good, enjoyable story. Great service to the lore. Titus is awesome. Dreadnoughts look amazing!

Operations (PvE): Fun, cooperative mayhem fighting across 6 missions (more to come).

Eternal War (PvP): N/A. Not played enough of this mode to really say.

Customisation: Outstanding! So many chapters in currently, including the Ultramarines DLC. If I had one thing to add, would be custom emblems, though I've seen enough games including them to know that can also go the wrong way.

Gameplay: Really visceral. Highly enjoyable. Feel like a Space Marine from Warhammer 40k. The combat loop has been great and I have enjoyed every encounter so, Operations has by far been the mode I have enjoyed the most outside of the Campaign.

Inconvenience: Eternal War and Operations both offer restrictions for team composition. While Eternal War (PvP) has a limit of 2 of the same class per match, Operations restricts you to 1 of each class (3-playters, 6 classes).

The frustrating thing is down to matchmaking on Operations not really engaging with the class you have selected and sometimes you join an in progress game on a difficulty you can do with your primary class, but someone else has taken it, now you are forced to run either a Lv 1 class you've never used, or back out and try again.

For Eternal War (PvP), I have found myself been able to select any class when I play, except on a couple of occasions when two players have chosen it, but this seems very uncommon, at least in the games I have played.

It gets everything that made the first part great and purposely made it better. Titus comes back true to himself and his duty as a primaris to take on enemies of the Emperium with bolter and blade.

It gets warhammer. Prepare to be enshrouded in the grim darkness of the far future side by side your brothers and the Cadian 8th.

Pros:
Shooting that bolter feels great
The Tyranids are not boring! (looking at you space hulk deathwing)
They managed to avoid dull grayness and make the scenery colorful without breaking the warhammerness of things
The marines and their counterparts depictions are awesome
Warhammer scenery in this game is a marvel to stare at - makes it almost a shame that the game is so fast paced
Fast paced hack and slash of epic proportions with a constant sense of urgency
Campaign length of 9ish hours is perfect for one or two overnight dips into this blend of wrath, metal and righteous fury

""Cons"":
The game is geared more towards action than grimdarkness. I personally do not mind at all and I dare say that it is a bit more grimdark than the first one.


warnings:
may boost testosterone to space marine levels
may cause you to shout ""FOR THE EMPEROR"" during play


The game delivered on my expectations and then some on a space marine game. Highly recommended!

caliosaaa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/caliosaaa/,"Its pretty good and satisfying to play. The campaign feels way longer than what it is but is about on average 12-25 hours depending on the difficulty you go with. The areas are gorgeous, and very linear. There are a couple missions that seem a bit odd where your character proposes a plan but ends up doing something entirely different and less cool while a supposed other squad in the story full fills it while you set about doing the exact same thing you have been doing the entire time killing ♥♥♥♥. I don't know if this was cut content but I was a little disappointed to find out there wasn't going to be a epic boss fight because some story squad that only exists on comms did it. There are a few coop operations that take the role of following along these squad's stories, but none of the really cool boss fights that could have existed are in those playlists. The class load outs are also very restrictive and lack variety for what I guess is balancing. Hoping more will be expanded on in future updates or dlc campaign. There are only two groups of enemies you end up getting to fight, but I was hoping to fight others in the operation mode. Will get very repetitive over time. Hopefully another thing that will be added in future.

The controls are a little restrictive with keybindings that serve multiple inputs being bound to the same thing. (Such as block and parry) Feels very clunky with one specific class in particular.

now for the complaints

stop matchmaking me the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people, the player pool should be refreshed after every match, this should be an obvious thing why is it not?
even if you wont refresh the player pool at least change players between teams like holy hell, the entire game can be extremely one sided.
also, why is there no team switching?
like I know both teams fundamentally are just the same but maybe I'd like to look more at my Adeptus Astartes Character, since that is the only side with a fleshed out customization.

second thing, one of the missions on Avarax is completely broken, the elevator mission (Machinus Divinitus).
I play with my friend the campaign and apparently AND only this part just breaks so often it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying.
ammo caches disappearing.
not being able to pickup weapons
or even meds, like how does this even pass QA?
i have to start the mission from the lobby just to fix it because it completely breaks if I fail that 1 part

I love the game, the customization and everything but for the love of god I can't continue the campaign if it keeps bugging out like this.

The gameplay, story, and meshing between game modes of this are 10/10. Campaign now has coop, there are now separate coop operations which tie into the storyline of the main campaign, and new maps and abilities for pvp.

+ Great and wide variety of weapons
+ The plot and characters all tie in well to the first game and the 40k universe both.
+ Amazing aesthetics and environmental design. This wholly immerses you in the grim darkness of

76561197966421086,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966421086/,"Got this mainly for the PvP, well made with room to grow.

So far I have encountered quite a few bugs, mostly with the cosmetics customization:
- Custom armor sets / cosmetics lost on exit and have to be redone.
- Some cosmetics combinations causing the game to crash upon exiting armor edit menu.
- Exiting the game sometimes causes it to get stuck and require ALT+F4 to close.
- ""Lost connection"" while in the ship and have to reconnect.

None are game-breaking and hopefully will be fixed in time.

Will be nice to get more PvP/PvE maps in the future (as per roadmap) as well as possibility to edit the armor and weapons of Chaos Marines for PvP (not just color).

Regarding PvP, the following should be addressed:

- Ability to report AFK / griefing / cheating players
- More balancing & specialization of classes, e.g. Assault gets + % melee dmg, Sniper + % movespeed, etc.
- Ability to remap specific buttons (playing with controller is a challenge)
- Melee should have more impact, interrupt or slow.
- Block/Balance/Fencing weapons on PvP.
- Matchmaking with Friendly Fire enabled (at least for ranged weapons)",Recommended,938,10.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

As someone well versed in the lore of this universe it brings me great joy to see every little detail handled with immense care and precision. As for the gameplay, I heavily reccomend this game if you're looking for the kind of experience provided by games like Vermintide 2 and Darktide. Melee combat is precise and requires a methodical approach, baiting out attacks in order to perform parries and granting occasional moments of respite from the swarm in order to execute a stronger foe with amazingly brutal animations that I have yet to get tired of.

I've mainly played the operations and pvp modes as the Bulwark, a melee focused class which I've found to be a great frontline fighter in both modes. His lack of a primary weapon for ranged combat is a weakness I haven't felt much, as secondary weapons in this game are still very effective and vital for the game's melee combat loop. Teamwork also makes the Bulwark a frighteningly powerful fighter, acting as a one way barrier in pvp, blocking bullets, light melee attacks, and some grenades with his thunder shield. His banner ability restores armor to teammates in an area around it, which also restores your entire health bar with rally health in operations, meaning you and your team can use a well timed banner and execution to heal back to full health.",Recommended,1189,35.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Short Review
Story - 9/10 ( will change after more content )
Gameplay - 8/10 ( some unique choices of jank but fluid (
Audio - 7/10 ( campaign has the good music )
Graphics - 9/10 ( campaign stands out, co op missions less so )
Overall Score - 9/10 ( i believe the game has a ton of potential which will just depend on the longevity of the game )

Longer ish Review
As someone who doesn't know too much about the world or lore but has been curious this game felt like a perfect fit to slowly grab my attention and pull me into its unique world. I grabbed my other two mates and played the campaign in full Co-op and had an absolute blast.

Currently we have only played on the 2nd difficulty ( standard ) and that felt like an ok casual challenge, but i could imagine the difficulty will pick up quite a bit later on. I will say in terms of replayability for campaign there isnt much incentive besides personal satisfaction for completing the campaign on other difficulties however Co-op missions have a decent amount of replayability so far due to multiple classes and leveling.

My last point will be based on the Solo and Co-op experience. Co-op has been a blast playing with my mates has been very enjoyable and we all have roles that suit our playstyles, however i will say a few of my public lobby experiences have been mixed. Solo however has been a bit of a journey, within the campaign it was not too bad with a decent difficulty here and there however in the co op operations it has proven to be quite a challenge on some missions to play solo. The game is quite new so i expect things to change over time so i am excited to see where things lead.",Recommended,1419,21.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Think there could be a bit more weapon variety / boss variety (hell even a few more than 6 PVE missions) which will hopefully get added in a bit as the games lifecycle goes on but 20 hours in and I'm really enjoying it.

Couple of issues:
Blur in cutscenes, I'm sure this is a very common thing but me + my friends have all had this where features seem to double and blur.
Customisation scroll wheel just tends to break every so often requiring a restart

Space Marine 2 is not just a worthy sequel to Space Marine 1, but in an entirely different league altogether. The cutscenes are better than most animated movies, the UI is nice and clean and the gameplay is extremely satisfying and much more in depth than SM1, due to parries, dodges and more weapon variety/ combos. The campaign is decently long and never feels like it's boring or padded with time-wasting content. The best thing about it is that it escalates throughout the story, meaning that every time you get used to how amazing it is, it surprises you with something even better!

You didn't try to reinvent the wheel, you stuck to making a very true to feel space marine experience with gorgeous levels, a true understanding of lore and super fun game play.

Campaign is bad ass, the weapons feel very punchy, the melee animation kills have not gotten old even after the thousandth time I've smashed a tyrannid against the metal floor, and the PVP is just good old strategic death match fun. Nothing crazy because it didn't have to be.

Simply put- this game, and games like it (TWWH3, BoltGun, Merchanicus) are what's going to breed the next generation of warhammer fans. Let the canon lore speak for itself, and let new fans fall in love with the story that we all have, if it was good enough to get us here, it's good enough for new people to come in and see whats next.

Welcome to the fantasy that has inspired every ""hulking super soldier in space, fighting bugs"" story you have ever seen. It's also fantastic to see the devs are only charging for cosmetic items and there's going to be tons of free content released over the next year.

THE GAME FEELS EPIC TO PLAY AND IS FUN!! This alone means it's worth it.

However there are some drawbacks. One, no switching camera sides on the fly. You are stuck being right hand advantaged, very annoying lame. No camera angle change, we're stuck in super zoomed in mode with a Space marine blocking the beautiful world. The movement feels a little sluggish or slow. Normal sprint can be faster. The difficulty spike is insanely bad. PVP is fun, but again, there is no point fighting with left side peeks, just peek right always.

Few nitpicks, the campaign is solid and this is what games should be like. It's a 7/10 for me. I love warhammer and have been a big fan of 40k Since the tabletop's 5th edition. I'm still here and spreading the word of this great universe.",Recommended,734,17.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The gameplay is exciting, the controls are easy to learn, the scale of the battles is impressive, the environments and structures make you feel like you're in a massive and dark world, and the combat is brutal and shocking in a good way. It feels a little similar to God of war games in several ways and thats a good thing.

The best part of the game is the visuals, particularly how many enemies you see on screen. You truly feel like you walk into the middle of huge battles and I love it. You also have a choice of several weapons which change how you play in certain ways, for example, a power sword is more powerful than a chain sword but the chain sword swings in a wider arc to hit multiple enemies more effectively.

The only downside I can really see for the game is the fact that if you are new to Warhammer 40k then you won't know the lore of this universe which is awesome. Also, I recommend playing the first game first for the story to make more sense. I actually think the story in these games are pretty good for the type of games they are, but in this type of universe don't expect a heartfelt drama or anything.

Kawaii-Five-o,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kawaii-Five-o/,"As a kid that got hooked on warhammer 40k from DOW and the original Space marine 2.... I loved this.

Fanboying aside and a gamer of 2024... this game like a (small) list of others is a breath of fresh air. This game delivers as promised and is worth the price of the gaming standard of today.

The game can be appreciated by 40k fans and new fans, and if you are not a lore junky its a good fit since you aren't having the 40k lore shoved down your throat like other games.

Notes about other comments:

- I haven't had Epic effect or done anything in this game.
- keeps politics and real life issues out of fantasy.
- A msi laptop can run the game on the preset settings with only a few frame drops (hardly noticed) when 30+ bugs are on screen.
- most screen sizes have been added to the game now.
- the negative comments bombing this game because fun just ain't their thing.


At the end of the day... if you're looking for a great fun co-op (and single player) intended fun with an amazing story... pick this game up. Don't let others being upset by an old work of fiction not meeting their personal feelings of what standards should be... sorry, not sorry..... Ruin your own opinion on what's cool and fun.

Make new stories and be creative, don't go after and ruin what other people love to prove a point that shouldn't matter in a work of fiction that's 40+ years old.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Review: A Dance of War and Glory

In the grim darkness of the far future, where hope is a whispered memory and the galaxy drowns in perpetual war, there stands the warrior: an embodiment of humanity's last, unwavering bastion. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 plunges you headfirst into this brutal universe, offering an exhilarating, visceral experience that reverberates through every pulse-pounding moment.

The World: Drenched in War
From the very first moment you set foot on the war-ravaged planets of the Imperium, Space Marine 2 offers an awe-inspiring vision of the Warhammer 40K universe. The environments are a dystopian symphony of iron, ruin, and death. Gigantic Gothic structures loom like silent witnesses to centuries of unending warfare, while distant explosions paint the sky a fiery orange. You don’t merely observe this world; you feel it in every clash of bolter fire and the thunderous impact of your chainsword cleaving through alien flesh.

The sense of scale here is monumental. This universe is so much larger than you, yet you march through it as one of the Emperor’s mightiest—an Adeptus Astartes. The art direction captures this perfectly: everything feels vast, overwhelming, as though the galaxy itself is folding under the weight of endless war. But you—clad in your mighty power armor—are its answer. Every corner of the battlefield feels alive, not only with the constant clash of battle but also with the oppressive atmosphere of hopelessness, which you, as a Space Marine, push back against with every swing of your blade.

Gameplay: A Symphony of Brutality
Where Space Marine 2 truly excels is in its fluid, bone-crunching combat. The gameplay is a refined art form, a violent ballet where every swing of the chainsword, every blast of the bolter, and every stomping charge into enemy hordes feels precise and devastating. There’s an elegance to the brutality; you're not just fighting—you’re executing a deadly dance of destruction.

The satisfying feedback loop of combining ranged and melee combat is nothing short of masterful. As a Space Marine, you seamlessly shift between mowing down swarms of enemies with your bolter to crushing them in savage close-quarters combat. The sound of your chainsword roaring to life as it rips through Tyranid hordes is a mechanical growl of death. Each kill feels personal, earned, and necessary, giving you a primal satisfaction only a game in this universe could deliver.

The sheer variety of enemies, from the chittering Tyranid monstrosities to hulking boss encounters, ensures that combat remains dynamic and engaging. The tactical depth, enhanced by a rich set of abilities and weapons, offers freedom in how you approach each skirmish. Do you wade into the fray, slaughtering enemies in a berserker fury, or do you hang back and rain down bolter rounds with terrifying precision? The game leaves the power in your hands, as any true Space Marine should wield it.

Narrative: For the Emperor!
The story of Space Marine 2 strikes at the heart of what makes the Warhammer 40K universe so enthralling. It's not a tale of simple good versus evil, but rather a reflection of the constant struggle for survival in a galaxy where even hope itself is a luxury. As Lieutenant Titus, you stand as a bulwark against the endless tide of alien invaders, your duty not just a responsibility but a sacred oath.

The weight of that duty is palpable throughout the campaign. Every decision feels like it carries the burden of the Emperor’s will, and the voice acting and dialogue add gravitas to the characters and their grim determination. The moments of triumph, when you finally stand victorious after a harrowing battle, are as fleeting as they are glorious. Yet, in those moments, you feel the righteous fury of the Imperium driving you onward, deeper into the heart of war.

The Soundtrack: War's Anthem
The music in Space Marine 2 is nothing short of a war hymn. It swells and crashes with the same ferocity as the battles you're fighting. The orchestral score lifts every moment to a crescendo of tension and victory, the perfect accompaniment to the violent, relentless nature of the game. Each clash of steel, each bolt fired, feels augmented by the grand, sweeping melodies, reminding you constantly of the epic scale of the conflict you are embroiled in.

The Visuals: Power, Purity, and Destruction
Visually, the game is a feast for fans of the Warhammer 40K universe. The hulking power armor of the Adeptus Astartes is rendered with such loving detail that you feel the weight of every step your character takes. The battle damage, the weathered, grimy look of your armor after endless fights—it’s all a testament to the unyielding strength of the Emperor’s chosen warriors. Environments, from shattered cities to alien-infested wastelands, are designed to not only challenge you but also immerse you in the chaos of galactic warfare. The sheer variety and detail are breathtaking.

Even the Tyranids, your relentless foe, are given meticulous attention. Their insectoid forms, swarming in their numbers, strike fear and disgust, as they should. Facing down hundreds of them makes every victory feel that much more heroic. The game pulls no punches in delivering spectacle—whether it's a massive battle scene or the quiet, eerie moments before the storm, everything feels grand.

Player Experience: The Glory and Grit of War
For a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Space Marine 2 feels like a gift. It’s everything you could want in a 40K experience: epic in scale, brutal in execution, and relentless in its pacing. But even for newcomers, the game offers a finely tuned, adrenaline-pumping third-person shooter that’s as accessible as it is satisfying.

The only criticism that may arise is that the game rarely lets you breathe. It's a non-stop barrage of battle, and while that’s part of its charm, it can feel exhausting for those who might crave a bit more variety in pacing. But for those who came here for war, this is exactly the experience they’ve dreamed of.

Final Verdict: 9.7/10
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 doesn’t just live up to the legend of the Adeptus Astartes; it honors it with every roar of bolter fire and every clash of chainsword against alien flesh. This is not a game for the faint of heart—it’s for those who revel in war, who take joy in standing against impossible odds and emerging victorious.

With its breathtaking combat, immersive world-building, and deep reverence for the source material, Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating and near-perfect dive into one of the most iconic universes in gaming. For the Emperor!",Recommended,5680,12.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

GamesTickUK,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GamesTickUK/,"Well worth it! if you new or a vet of Wh40k great fun! I do have my recommendations on now to play the campaign. DON'T main line the campaign. Instead when you unlock a new Co-op mission (Operations) play those related to the up coming main story. The Co-op mission provide a lot of set piece action and context to the main story, as they act as supporting actions or shaping operations for the campaign. While the main story missions tie it all together. Doing it this way I found to make the story really fulfilling. In case there are those who need it, here's an in depth mission list.
1. Rain of Terror
2. Skyfire
3. Inferno (co-op mission)
4. Severance
5. Machinus Divinitus
6. Servant of the Machine
7. Decapitation (co-op mission)
8. Vox Liberatis (co-op mission)
9. Voidsong
10. Reliquary (co-op mission)
11. Fall of Atreus (co-op mission)
12. Dawn's Descent
13. Bellum Sempiternus
14. Duty Without End

With that said i do have issues with some parts of the story. There are some really epic moments that don't last long enough. One example, there's a last stand moment that i was feeling super hype for but it only lasts for a minute before it jumps into a cut scene. If I was to make some changes to it make it last for about another minute maybe and the start of that cut scene happen in game before the cutting to it.

On to the multiplayer its cool but feels slow. There is also a jammy exploit that players are using to hide their characters around corners and shot through cover thanks to the camera angle. Could be great if they fix these issues.

Tech thoughts
Controls are good for using a controller but the default for PC is a bit off recommend re-mapping them.
I've had no performance issues. The serves can feel a bit slow but for the size of the community they are hosting i can't complain.

Altogether a solid game. One of the top games I've played this year. I only hope the devs and publishers take their time making the next one. Would hate to see them rush the next game because of the success of this one.",Recommended,1680,26.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The game is okay. Campaign was fun - but immensely short. But for the love of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Christ you can't cancel a Public Beta test - Give it to youtubers and be like ""Yeah this'll do."", Polishing Graphics is fine but do SOME in-game mechanic polishing.

(Subject to CHANGE)

Visuals - 9.8/10, Hive city was sick - all very cool. I like.
10 Hour Campaign - It's nice but its 10 hours. They shoved the background things into PvE which was cool. I wish the Guardsman did more things, but lets be honest if they programmed every Guardsman my PC would burn down my house.
PvE - unpolished and untested (Blackrock dollars went somewhere else ._.)
PvP - It's PvP it has a meta you follow it you win, you don't its pretty meh.
Customization - ♥♥♥♥, lack luster & bound to take years to come out thanks to their special little choices. (Check Road map)(I'm a half white half asian Heavy Salamander. Explain that.) (Iron Warriors are piss bronze temu Custodes?)
Weapons - FEEL Great, Variety is missing a lot of very BASIC things (I want my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flamer GW) a lot of weapons you'd expect but its not really there. (WHERES MY FLAMER GW)

I've been loving this but I am a 40K fan so your mileage may vary, but I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in the Warhammer universe or looking for a fun and engaging 3rd person shooter with deep melee combat and based on what the devs have said, a healthy support roadmap with new weapons, enemies and modes in the future

There is a big BUT however.
After a retry sometimes characters dialogue is extremely quiet.
Headshots with the Sniper Rifle are NOT consistent.

It says Veteran for the campaign is the intended experience.
What it doesn't say is that it is clearly the intended experience with 3 people because the AI is absolutely abysmal.
At points where 1 person is supposed do the objective, another uses a specific weapon to do a task or take out certain enemies and the last handles the rest YOU WILL BE MANICALLY TRYING TO DO ALL 3 ROLES WHILE THE AI IS DOING NOTHING OR BEING STUPID.

I keep rage quitting at those points then coming back, since it restores your health etc it makes it a little easier but the fact I'm rage quitting because the AI doesn't pull it's weight compared with 2 other people is not a good experience.",Recommended,697,14.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

This is a realy good action, third person shooter, hack and slay. The presentation is realy cinematic, no corners were cut. Sound is awesome. Everything feels heavy and powerfull. You can eighter life out your power fantasy by playing on easy or dive realy deep into the challanges of the combat system.

In the beginning it can feel a little strange but once you get the hang it´s realy good.

Marine Customisation is realy good, with some nice underdog chapters. Chaos customisation is a bit lacking but I am sure the devs will attend to this.

- La campagne est intense
- Ca bourrine sec et c'est dynamique.
- Le mode coop est sympa et accompagne la campagne sans l'imiter.
- La personalisation (classes et armures) sont au top et immersifs

Les moins:
- On sent que le jeu aurait mérité ""un poil"" plus d'effort sur l'entre-missions... Aller à la salle de briefing... redescendre... monter dans le vaisseau.. et on recommence à chaque fois.
- Le end-game est vite redondant à la sortie du jeu. Il faudra attendre quelques mois pour avoir des missions supplémentaires.
- On aurait aimé un genre de mode conquête galactique en coop ou quelque chose du genre avec une bonne grosse map galactique qui montre que toute la communauté participe au conflit contre les Xenos.
- Le système TPS qui te fait envoyer un shoot dans tes équipiers un tir sur 3 lorsqu'ils sont proches
- Pas de support Ultrawide dès la sortie du jeu. Il faut attendre plusieurs semaines. Pas de chance. j'ai déjà fini le jeu. ça flingue un peu l'immersion.

Je suis externe au monde Warhammer 40K mais je dois dire que j'ai adoré le jeu, les personnages, le gameplay et j'aimerais beaucoup approfondir ma connaissance de cet univers.

I liked the coop mode and the way it ties in with the campaign. Should've been more missions, hopefully they'll release more of them. Orks as enemies would be nice. Also, the connection sometimes randomly slowing down for no apparent reason and missing models (even after the patch) marr the experience.

FuckingEidgenoss,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckingEidgenoss/,"I just played the main campaign so far. No Side missions or PVE/PVP and I would recommend it already. Without getting into much detail I'd say it's all very good. Graphics, gameplay, story, setting, variety, voice acting, controls etc.

I have some minor gripes: Bolters should pack more punch, Enemies turning to bulletsponges on highest difficulty and the fact how difficult it is to actually reach an enemy to get stuck in melee. But maybe that was part of the point? Difficult to say.

What Saber Interactive really, just absolutely nailed were the huge megalithic buildings you'd expect to see in an imperial hive city. Under an open sky no less. (Darktide fans will know.) The setting, worldbuilding and atmosphere are spot on, perfect.

The story was cool and the final mission felt like a redemption for Space Marine 1's quicktime event last boss.",Recommended,715,20.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 15
nordanix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nordanix/,"Verdict: Amazing & Fun that I would recommend to anyone!

+ Gorgeous Graphics, Atmosphere & Visual Design

+ Smooth Gameplay & Combat
+ Lots of QoL Settings
+ Great Performance Maxed
+ Larger than life battles
+ Replayability with tons of progression in perks, talent trees, weapons, customizations, etc

- Crashes (Mission 3 and Final Boss respectively. But eventually I managed to get through them)
- Blurry (Forced TAA)
- Angel of Death isn’t really as difficult as I thought it would be (outside some “defend” situations), which is a bit of a let down.
Stupid AI Teammates. Sometimes they won’t even help you get up after being downed at all, thus ending up dying as they keep fighting.

Things I liked:
-Combat (A third person shooter, hack n slash hybrid. Love it)
-Environments (This game is stunning)
-Sound design (You feel heavy and your weapons sound very nice)
-Fashion (I might have spend a bit too much on customization
-Story (I really enjoyed the main campaign

Things I disliked:
-Music is boring (Compared to other 40k titles)
-Progression is terribly long
-Little to no replayability (Replaying the same mission over and over is not fun)
-Difficulty is a little boring. (Enemies get more health for some reason)

I would have loved to see a replayable activity on launch. A PVE activity that did not involve the same mission over and over is always welcome. I saw that a Horde mode was comming in 2025.

The space marines feel clunky and hits are weighty, meaty strikes that turn xenos into meat carpets for the Emperor's gloriously chosen to walk upon. Weapons, for the most part, feel strong, and as with the heavy bolter, have a chunkiness to the firing that is satisfying while holding back a large horde.

Introducing a parry mechanic is a welcome addition to a 40k horde shooter, adding some technical variety to what is usually just a block and swing playstyle. Not to mention how well timed dodges can be rewarded with a follow up headshot.

However, something about the classes feels wanting. I don't find the level of variety that I did in Dark Tide between choosing a psyker, or say, the veteran class and a couple of the classes feel wanting in general. Looking at the Bulwark and Assault marines specifically.

In all, the game is fun and it is what it is, a 40k horde shooter that satisfies that power fantasy itch to be one of the glorious Emperor's chosen to assert humanity's stake in the grim dark future.",Recommended,1005,5.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

Melee combat is very sattisfying, with c you are able to block incoming melee attacks and you can also finish enemies with e which gives you shield and sometimes health back.

You can play solo, but most of the fun is the coop mode.

TheCosmicDevourerDragon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCosmicDevourerDragon/,"As someone who enjoys 40k & The fantasy series, this game hits most of if not all the right bars.

Story: The story isn't on the same level as God of War: Ragnarok, Halo trilogy, or the older call of duty games. It is short, if you skip the operations in between each mission. However I say it's pretty damn good for a 40k game.

Graphics: The scenery is gorgeous, surprisingly a bit optimized, although like most games now days you need to have a solid pc to experience them. With a 3070ti & A Ryzen 9 5950X, I've played on the highest graphics settings with 60+ fps. The best of it is definitely the scenery & cinematics, which are grand and epic in proportions.

Gameplay: The gameplay is fun, and the mechanics that exist in the game have a bit of difficulty to them but in due time you can learn and master them. I went from the tutorial mission giving me some difficulty in getting my butt kicked although not dying, to being able to never lose a singular health point, since you can regain armor relatively easy. My general experience is playing the game on the 2nd hardest difficulty.

Multiplayer: On pve side operations is harder than the story with some classes over others, Assault feeling like the weakest due to restricting the jump pack movement which isn't consistent to the campaign or pvp, to the rest having extremely fun experience and high survivability like the Bulwark. I haven't touched pvp too much, but its alright, it's not like 40k Eternal crusade (RIP), and the time to kill feels faster than that game which isn't bad. However the elephant in the room is that cheaters do exist. Yes the game has only been out for 6 days officially + 4 from early access. The cheaters are able to do the following: Shoot through walls, have sight of everyone, able to switch teams somehow and have many more abilities yet to be seen but from what I heard they can do a lot.. But it was only 1 out of a lot of matches have yet to see another.

: This unfortunately isn't the strongest quality of the game, a lot of effort was put into the campaign and that is definitely shown, 6 operations, 5 of which are tied to the story and 1 being side content. Each operation takes about 20 minutes to complete, varies based on difficulty and whether you are alone or not. Mostly your grind is leveling the different classes, which levels do not carry between Operations & Eternal war what does carry is Cosmetics & money. I've found Eternal war to be better at getting cosmetics & money as operations is much slower and rewards you different through armoury data for weapon upgrades all in all it needs more improvement and additions. Luckily there's a roadmap that already features new weapons for later, maps, operations & even classes.

All in all the game is very good and I recommend for newcomers to 40k or long standing story lore Librarians, the future of the game is unknown however the popularity of the game will show whether Focus Entertainment & Saber Interactive would wanna add to the game after Season 4 or end up working on a new title. 9/10.",Recommended,2513,72.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

What this game is: Just good. I feel I'm playing a game from 10-20 years ago, it's just plain simple fun without any woke agenda behind it trying to sterilize it or denuvo. It's almost like playing a 3rd person Doom.

I wasn't really in the mood to play but didn't want to waste my night on youtube, so I forced myself to launch the game last night for just 1 mission... 3 hours later... I had to force myself to stop.

Play it in Normal though. I normally play games on hard, but it seems that both difficulties above Normal are unbalanced. If I want to get frustrated while playing games I would play Dark Souls (Hey hey, I appreciate Dark Souls and find it to be a great game)

Negative:
- No ultrawide support
- Dodge doesn't feel responsive
- Difficulties above normal are unbalanced
- Freezes when exiting the game
- Using EAC as anticheat is like trying to put out a forest fire by peeing on it.

76561198118297124,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118297124/,"It's a game that really has all the signs to be a great game but and if I could I'd probably give this game an 'average' rating. Most of my issues come from the really odd choice of making this game play more like dark souls then space marine or really any other third person shooter.

The game was clearly not all that thoroughly tested as the incredibly chunkiness of the controls is a infuriating issue. Parry indicators are present but are super inconsistent and the timing for them is all over the place such as the Ravener having the indicator at the start of the wind up but the animation being so long the parry ends before it attacks and you get hit anyways or the fodder who just auto jump into your parry attack the moment you hit the button.

It doesn't help that this game seems horribly animation driven in every aspect as animations are locked the moment they start meaning you will often get hit trying to perform certain attacks because the game will prevent you from canceling it with a dodge. Damage is so violently overtuned that the little ♥♥♥♥♥ are vastly more lethal then the actual majors who are themselves only lethal en-masse which becomes real common and having a squad of warriors or rubricae spawn up my ass doesn't exactly lead to fun when every engagement ends with me rolling 36 times, and spamming melee in the hopes something becomes executable and even then that will only heal armor and not health for some reason and a lot of the time it's just safer to shoot the enemy more then try and get close for an execution unless there one of the last people around.

I don't think I need to explain the issues with always online, the game seemingly balanced for coop single player be damned, and the AI being 'special' while 95% of the enemy is focused solely on you and are hyper aggressive to an almost oppressive level. Executions not stunning targets around you and melee having very little crowd control. Almost every enemy locking you into animations or staggering you with some form of special attack.

Regardless of all this ♥♥♥♥, I still like the game. I just hope they go about some changes so the game doesn't just feel like a tedious slog to even play and this is on the lowest difficulties. Higher difficulties just sound like an abject pain that really isn't worth the effort save for being forced to due to the armory progression system that I fundamentally hate on requiring higher difficulty to progress.

It's an average game with a lot of weird changes from the first that just make the game far less enjoyable and more tedious to play. Fun in coop if about as annoying to play, Maybe they might change or fix some stuff later but I probably wont be playing much more of this game outside of my friends wanting me to.

However, if they're only going to allow one of each class per operation, you need to be able to queue as said class instead of joining a game and picking a class.

Warhammer 40k has inspired countless pieces of media as it was inspired by its own and purely off the visuals and branding, we see constant inspirations of this world through games like Halo and Starcraft. But for countless years, we have yet to have a sequel that takes the player truly into the boots of their star cast... and here we are once again, Welcome.

Plot: to the uninitiated, you play as Titus a Space Marine of the Ultramarines chapter, one of countless Adeptus Astartes who are made of the genetic material of several sons of the late Emperor of Mankind. He serves as a truly rare sight to the common man and along with his Battle Brothers have earned the prestige and status as ""Angels of Death"". Humanity faces countless threats such as the dreaded Hivemind of ever-evolving aliens, the fungal barbaric Orks, the elusive Eldar, the united and mechanized Tau, the ancient undying Necrons, and their own traitorous brothers who fell into the hands of demonic Chaos gods.
During his adventures against the Orks, he was tainted by the energy of Chaos and serves penance by order of the Inquistion, a shadowy authoritative agency that serves almost as the status quo in the power vacuum of the late Emperor.
It is in this penance he finds himself facing the Tyranids and is given a twisted chance of fate, to be reborn as the latest developement of the Imperium of Man's technological doctrine to become a ""Primaris"" Space Marine. Bigger, badder, and with new armor, weapons, and strategies by the order of the Ultramarine's Primarch Roboute Guilliman, who has stepped forward, awakened from death, prepared to allow humanity to rise once again as a power in the 41st millenia.

But has your new augmentations rid you of your curse and how will your brothers react as your dirty past comes to haunt you once more?

Gameplay: Much like Space Marine 1, you are given a remarkable sense of control over Titus or any Space Marine you control during your cooperative or PVP modes. Your left mouse button will control any firearm you have and your right mouse button (depending on presses and holds) will execute combos. These combos paired with a decent parry and dodge system will allow your Space Marine to deal with tougher opponents, wound them to perform an execution or gunshot combo which will heal any grey-bar health and fill your armor meter.
During your journey across space you will use this as the foundation to hold, escort, and solve minor puzzles as you face waves, boss fights, or other players in a narrative that ties any and ALL content together in the canon of the universe.

Sound: embrace the audio that may not be revolutionary, but sings the bloody song of a world far beyond our own. Each of your guns fires a rocket propelled loaded projectile or energy from a 10ft tall human wearing essentially ceramic armor, and you FEEL these truth in every trigger pull, every chainsaw rev, and every crackle of energy from hammers, jetpacks, and more.

Voice acting: be fully aware that the Ultramarines are the prime ""standard"" of the emotional and physical display of the Imperium of Man's finest. While they may seem rather dull with their zealotry to brotherhood and their doctrine and ethics book ""the Codex Astartes"", every actor fits nicely into the mythos of a world dictated by minature figures. Plenty of them may not be A-List actors but they surely know the topic enough to not phone it in.

Optimization: as for writing several issues are both on the radar of fans as well as the developer. I have suffered no crashes upon patches but a really hit-and-miss connection to servers to play with friends and randoms. This is the most critical problem for a game that looks drop-dead-gorgeous- even with the lowest of low settings. CPU usage is high across some rigs and again the developers are active, aware, and frankly obligated considering 2 million people bought this niche title.

Coop and Multiplayer.
You can enjoy the campaign cooperatively as Titus is held by two of his peers as well as a secondary story that plays very much like Splinter Cell Conviction where you ARGUABLY have a story just as good as the campaign, but in the context of a faster paced and more difficult multiplayer setting. These fit the campaign proper and despite the non-canon nature of using your personal customized marines, they still fit the necessities of the plot.
Even the multiplayer has a place in the story where you face head to head across three game modes with other players.
The only issue with the multiplayer, at this time, is some minor balances, the connectivity, and frankly ZERO customization from the Heretic Astartes, but brownie points are given for at least the creativity of fitting several chapters as your player character.

Across ALL modes you will unlock weapons, cosmetics, and find lore in all of your transactions in-game.

Monetization: as of right now you only need to pay a minor DLC which is intended to give players extra colors, decals, and designs inspired by the secondary chapters of the Ultramarines. In other words, the Ultramarines have their own ""cousins"" of sorts, all with their own backstory and popularity, and you pay for those armor presets. There is no pay-to-win mechanics and frankly not every player needs to purchase anything beyond JUST the title to enjoy the game.

Nitpicks: there is admittedly no means to glory kill to regenerate health on higher difficulties, which sort of works backward to the gameplay pace and design. The heretic astartes got not love in the multiplayer and frankly your first enemies are the most interesting in the campaign.

Roadmap: the community does have a looseform roadmap displayed on social media that aims to add more classes, more coop missions, and expansions to the multiplayer for the longterm. This IS the future of Warhammer 40k titles save for Darktide that has a weird spot in the market right now. The future looks very bright as the success of this title, paired with the necessity to do justice to the frontcharacters are important to the brand... this isn't Darktide which is niche within itself.

Final verdict (first impressions)
Just buy it, my fingers hurt typing all of this but I do so because I have faith in this title far more than I have with other bug stomping games of this year. My only SIGNIFICANT FAULT of the game is the lack of an FOV slider because this game was in memory of the beautiful man we call John ""Totalbiscuit"" Bain and even then that's more out of humor than something damning.
Saber has done an incredible job at making a game that can rightfully surpass the necessities of Eternal Crusade and be the new standard of a marketable 40k title while sticking true to the source material with just enough fanservice and breadcrumbs for everyone to enjoy. I sincerely hope you join us in the fight.

Considering I like classes I don't expect, said ""WOW"" multiple times as a novice of the universe (trust me, this is LIGHT compared to what others know), and the joy I have of this... it's worth every penny in a market that nickles and dimes the average consumer.

You can paint, play, and enjoy Space Marines in THIS GAME for $60 MSRP and not even have to walk into a brick and mortar game store... that's a steal on its own and theres plenty of people in the community who will happily play with you beyond your adventures here in other titles... that's the BEAUTY of this.

xNineLives,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xNineLives/,"(Review made 1 week after full launch of the game, if you're reading this, the review has not been edited since.)

TL;DR Action hack-and-slash with good story, characters and voice acting. Amazing graphics and art direction. Good violent gameplay. And ok, separate, more replayable gamemodes like pve missions and pvp.
I recommend this game to anyone already interested in Warhammer. Else, it is 7/10, with optimization, pacing (loadscreens and cutscenes), connectivity, and, balance issues. With fun, but, underbaked pve and pvp modes.

--

Space Marine 2 is an action hack-and-slash story (and later pve, pvp) game, set in the grand and 'grimdark' Warhammer 40k universe, that follows the protagonist Titus from the first game. And whilst there are nods to the first, it is not a requirement to play the game, nor understand its characters or story.

Your avatar is as a Space Marine (or Astartes as lore-nerds like me would correct), a manufactured warrior class of humanity: Genetically modified, mentally conditioned, cybernetic, and religiously zealous post-humans, clad and armed in equipment more befitting a tank than man. And your job as one is to stop the invasion of the Tyranids: Unending waves of beasts from beyond the galaxy, controlled by a hivemind that can only feel HUNGER. They have arrived to devour, and their gluttony demands entire worlds.

As you rip and tear through the alien the nuance of characters, story, and narrative will slowly progress, leading to question about both, your so called allies, and the true happenings behind the alien invasion, all the while introduced to new ways to kill and maim through weapon choices and more challenging foes, although the gameplay loop remains relatively similar, and gorey throughout. Whilst set to the backdrop of fantastical Warhammer 40k settings that truly make even the superhuman soldiers you play as, feel small and inadequate.

Boss battles that will be thrown your way are going to be rather tough (veteran difficulty: one dev's intended to be the difficulty to play the game through), and once defeated for the first time, you're expected to fight them regularly at a later point... Baring especially special boss fights which, from an art-direction standpoint are genuinely amazing and rememberable, and I will not be spoiling them for you here.

Whilst in the main story you battle as the protagonist Titus, he, as a lieutenant, sends squads of other space marines on separate, but just as important to the game story, missions. These you can play through the 'Operations' coop pve mode, where you choose a loudout through class types, and through successful completions upgrade your equipment and perks to be able to handle harder difficulties of missions, and most importantly, customize your marine to look as rad as possible, or just paint them hot pink.

This mode plays nearly exactly as the main story does, and since there are only (currently) 6 missions available, of which, some are inherently harder than others, and you will need to complete MANY to fully progress ONE class to the point of being able to handle harder difficulties, this mode ends up unreasonably grindy, especially since each mission will take 30-50 mins. This also has the unintended consequence of both, having to 'main' a class (only use one for the time being) so you can have any sense of progression, and have to use un-fun tactics to speedrun through missions, since xp and currency is solely tied to mission completion, whether you killed 1 or 1000 aliens, matters nothing. This is very much an area the developers need to refine.

Speaking of refining: The PvP mode 'Eternal War', is extremely halfbaked. You play as space marines either on the Loyalist side, or the Traitor side, withe each operations class. It has just the right amount of raw content (maps, gamemodes, hints, progression, character customization, voice acting, graphics/ui) to be in a 'passable' state: It feels more like an alpha, as the balance is off, there is no traitor customization, no stats screen, no explanation of what the gamemodes are, only 3 maps and 3 gamemodes, and melee being very rudimentary, and yet, it is fun despite all of that. So as a gamemode to play infrequently, it is welcomed, but needs far more love and care put into it than the developers currently have, as if this gamemode was made as a separate game, it would rightfully flop.

And speaking of flops: The game, and it's sales, do very much ride on the fact that this game is set in the Warhammer 40k universe, a universe the fans-of (like me) will pretty much consume regardless of quality nor nutrition, and if this game, the exact same as it is now launched, but was not set in this setting, it would not have achieved even a tenth of its success. Which is very notable, as if one is not interested in the setting, or actively dislikes it, selling you this product is going to be far tougher than for a fan, and as such, as much as I do 'recommend' this product, it very much has it's strengths, and it's weaknesses. It is far from a necessary video game experience to consume, and at a later point the game might have improved drastically, and be sold on sale...

As such, a 7/10 overall rating is fitting, as whilst I would put the story mode itself higher, other modes, ones which demand more gameplay time from you, are in a worse position than it. Hence, the overall experience of this game will be dragged down by them and the (currently) inherent flaws of the game.",Recommended,4583,34.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The campaign is fun- not brilliant but fun- and you FEEL like a Marine. You feel tough and dangerous. The characters are a bit stock but if you were expecting Shakspeare, you wouldn't be playing a 40k game!

But the big thing that makes me hurt is... you can barely customize your character if you want to do any of the other game modes without what looks to be HOURS of grinding and grinding and grinding to get tiny amounts of a not-very-intuitive resource to unlock COLORS and armor parts. Okay, armor parts I would have understood, but COLORS!? REALLY? And you can't just unlock the bits you want, you have to unlock them as parts of packages, in order, and slowly. And to add insult to insult, you can't grind any of this up solo- you MUST be in a multiplayer game. Oh, and all of the costs are hidden. How much does a full unlock of a single chapter's heraldry take? Pft, you don't get to know! Are they all the same? Nah, you don't get to know that either!

I... WANT to like this game more than I do. I love the singleplayer/co-op campaign. But the non-story mode stuff is really falling on its face.

The only real gripe I have is that even with running on my computer with the recommended hardware I still have stuttering in random places during combat, nothing game breaking, definitely noticeable though. There are some other minor dislikes, no easy way of adding recently played with people to friends list, no in game friends list, and some bugs, i.e. continuous loading.

Overall the game is gorgeous. Cinematics and campaign are very cool and interesting. Especially if you have some curiosity towards the Warhammer universe. The party system is kind of buggy and not the greatest but good after you get going. However I found the operations mode extremely uninteresting, pretty boring, and repetitive. Hopefully they follow through on the roadmap and add some content to add some replay value to the game as there is so much potential. PvP mode is currently in a terrible state, there's basically no progression, as example, you'll have to play a ridiculous amount to unlock items like the chainsword across all the classes even though some classes already come with it and there's no usage restriction in the operations mode. In terms of combat hopefully they plan to overhaul it as it has as there's are quite a bit of annoying aspects like assault class's ability being stronger than utilizing a sticky bomb.

Outstanding visuals matched with a coop campaign which is a rare sight indeed. I generally do not like multiplayer games, but this one is probably one of my favorite games. I played the original from beginning to the end and played the multiplayer with friends. Many games want to be either an MMO or a single player game with a multiplayer mode, which is kind of depressing. This game addresses the core problem with many cookie cutter games that just refuse to realize (I am looking at you Bethesda) that wanting a game with friends does not equal wanting an ""MMO experience""-coop is the way forward not backwards.",Recommended,533,9.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 15

The story is rich, the characters are well done, and the atmosphere is palpable throughout the campaign. More than anything else though: Space Marine 2 is a game that makes me feel like I was heard. The game stays true to the core of 40k and incorporates much of the existing lore into an amazing rendition of that world.

The combat system takes some getting used to but it is akin to Helldivers and Gears of War blended with a somewhat ""Souls-like"" play style. Dodging, timed strikes and blocks, run gunning, and simply brute force are all options. Different combat strategies are rewarded differently with different enemy types and I enjoyed the challenge. On Veteran difficulty you absolutely have to be more careful and consider what enemies you are fighting our else you will get absolutely mogged. The combat is addictive and exactly what I think of when I read a 40k book. The flashlights are also fairly lore accurate which is awesome haha.

I highly recommend this game:

Pros:
-Fantastic landscape and world design. Highly rich environments with stunning visuals and details
-Plays fantastic. The combat system works great with minimal bugs and the game appropriately rewards strategy
-True to the lore and ties in nicely with the original game
-Very palpable passion in the writing and development. This game was made for true 40k fans and new fans alike. It leaves you excited to play again.
-Great PvP and PvE coop options

Cons:
-Audio bugs for me have been most common. Muffled audio randomly after cutscenes or death is my most frequent bug but even then are not persistent and resolved with rebooting the game.
-I wish the campaign was a smidge longer. I got a solid 8hrs out of my first playthrough on veteran, and I stopped to look at things and explore the NPCs conversations as I went. This is somewhat made-up for in the coop mission mode.
-Some of the enemies are serious bullet sponges and when playing solo campaign the enemies tend to target you far more than your NPC allies. Normally this would be ok, but when cooping the enemies target everybody in a more balanced way and that did make the missions more enjoyable simply because the mobs don't drown you in harass on top of tougher enemies.

There are also some obvious areas where the game can be expanded, and I really look forward to it.

I have not yet played the PvP heavily but in the brief time I did try it I enjoyed it.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are a 40k fan this game is worth every penny of full price. If you are a Helldivers/Gears of War/Halo fan you will probably love it too, and this game makes a decent into to 40k but you will have to google some things (Such as Space Marine structuring and who the Emperor is, but don't worry YouTube is rich in lore vids).",Recommended,2465,11.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Died a few times in the tutorial trying to learn the dodge and parry needed in combat. This game wont be for everyone.

Its a Fantastic Followup to Space Marines 1 Story in the 6 Campaign Missions for it.
Downside, it needed a few more more hours or 8 Campaigns would have been better imo.

Fun Co-op Missions with friends for leveling up Classes and Weapons.
Downside, Matchmaking needs more work with load times taking 2-3 minutes at worst in some cases (supposedly better since this last patch but I'm still noticing it at times).
Another Nitpick, the Difficulty Spike for getting purple armory data is rather rough (3rd hardest) and having a weak ammo crate or two nearby those surprise boss spawns with HP bar is needed.

Haven't had a chance to do the PvP stuff yet due to working on Co-Op. Will get to it later although i've heard good things so I can not comment on it.

The addition of co-op play and bigger, more varied enemies is nice but can seem a bit same-y when grinding. The RNG in level design does make up for that a bit tho.

76561198035794974,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035794974/,"I'm going to keep this simple and to the point.

28 hours on record, the campaign is NOT 6-7 hours. It's a fun campaign that captures all of the feel of WH40K. If you are a Warhammer fan then you should definitely pick this up.

i9 Intel 12900 32 gigs of ram, SSD and a 3070, all on high settings. I stay away from AMD because I tried a pc with it once and it gave me constant blue screens. Anyway, during my full playtime never once crashed, no graphical issues , no overheating, only had a slowdown twice during a heavy battle scene and that lasted 2 seconds. Never got a constant disconnect, or an endless loop of anything. I read the reviews from others and honestly it's a hardware problem and not the game. People don't want to believe it could be something on their end so they will just blame it on the game.

Gameplay is very fun but this is a game about timing. There is a parry system but in being truthful, it was not explained that you CAN parry all melee attacks (not the orange ones) without the color notifier. Also the game will punish you for button mashing, as I said it's a lot about timing. If you are firing your bolter recklessly then you won't have the time to parry in time. The game could be viewed as a dance of sorts, don't get greedy and be aware and ready to always block, parry or dodge.

Is the game perfect? No game is, but they did a great job with this one. It SHOULD have launched with horde mode, and I also think you should be able to customize the face of your marine even if just using in game presets. I also think it would be amazing to add another enemy faction (Necrons, Aeldari, more chaos legions) in the game but it's early and who knows what the future holds. All paid Dlc is just cosmetics which is good too.

I played PvP and PvE, both are fine but a little shallow, I'm hoping they flesh it out more in the future. All in all it's great and a game I'm glad I purchased. The longevity of the game NEEDS Horde mode asap while waiting on the other things the devs have planned on the roadmap.",Recommended,1651,32.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561199224724752,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199224724752/,"As someone who has NEVER touched the 40K games, I am BEYOND impressed with what I have played. The campaign may be only 6 missions. But it is an immersive experience you won't forget. Take your time in this, it is well worth every bit of your attention.

My view:
Story 10/10: Titus and Co are top tier VA's and have amazing chemistry in this story. Even if there is (like previously mentioned) only 6 missions. It is like watching a movie and being in the universe yourself as an actual Space Marine!

Operations: The game has separate, 3 man operations that take place as the separate squads doing tasks in Titus' storyline. Here you select Classes and their desired loadouts as well. While I may point out and not necessarily agree with the class locking, I believe in some portions it is to get everyone playing a different class to freshen up the player experience.
Playing and succeeding in these operations provide you with the ""currency"" (or points more accurately speaking) to buy better gear/better perks for you and your team. And also unlock decals/paints to TRULY ADORN THE EMPEROR'S WILL

PVP: PVP is a 6v6 format with their respective modes. There is still a class selection with this and this also provides a challenging experience against other players in the lobby!

Misc notes: There are no micro-transactions in this game. There is no ""shop"" or anything of the sort. You can earn almost everything in game via the operations and pvp.
The only exception is the Season Pass ($40) you can purchase that is a one time buy. It provides you with the rest of the cosmetics you can earn in Operations. And in continuing ""Seasons"" that is laid out by the devs, there will be exclusive gear/content available to you if you have the pass. There will be content for everyone regardless. But a little more for the eager ones willing to make the one-time buy

WHY IS THE POWER CREEP SO BAD?

Allow me to explain myself. Ever find yourself trying to level your marine up and you start the threat level of substantial? If so then you know what i mean. The tyranids are just too powerful. I dont even feel like a marine in some levels. You have the trailer showing titus rip through hormagaunts and termagaunts in single hits / bullets yet in game it takes a strength level 13 sword 3 full swings to kill 1.

It feels sometimes like i have instead become a guardsman who discovered an abandoned suit of power armour and started flailing my arms about. If i had any suggestions to the devs its to maybe more accurately portray the strength of these tyranids. Wanna make the level harder? Just add more enemies to the base operation and increase the probability of an extremis level enemy spawning. I want to feel like a marine, not a grunt guardsman who has nothing but a rifle and his lost hopes and dreams.

The game play loop is pretty simple, but very fun. The game is well paced, and unlike the first entry doesn't wait till the end to change up the enemy types. The only down side is it's short. Really really short. I think if they would have side tracked Titus like make him do more death watch mission's, or maybe give him more exploration/ fetch quest's. The Main campaign is well appointed though but still only 10 hours. I didn't get into a team mission so I can't comment on that aspect of the game. I would have liked it if I could have changed/ customize Titus just to make him look like hes my space marine. The cinematic's were good, I would have liked to seen Bobby G show up, but Calgar was good to. If your a fan of WarHammer it's a must get. If you do not like GW you will wonder how it turned out so well O.O.... Get ready Brother's tons of heretics to purge.
P.S they could have added more to make the game longer. Examples... Titus could have done a another mission in the death watch. We could have played as the dreadnaught. We could have done out missions as titus and his team, then play the parallel mission as the other team after or during. We could have had a section where we were the hive mind directing then forces around.

formlessfunction,https://steamcommunity.com/id/formlessfunction/,"It has it's pros and cons but overall I'm having a lot of fun with it.

PvE right now has some connectivity, crossplay and server-side problems but I think anyone who has played a Saber game previously probably understands that was coming. They've never really had a game kick off as big as this and are probably a bit overwhelmed. They're constantly working on it though so we can't really complain. I have also noticed it can be quite difficult to time parries and dodged right when the ping is a bit higher (playing with friends from other continents) so that can be pretty frustrating.

PvP has a lot of problems but I also feel, after having played a bit of it, that it's just a tacked on game mode and not something that any real investment was placed into. There's a number of pretty seriously balancing problems and I'm not sure there is a way to fix them all without ruining the PvE experience or entirely segregating the two game mode (not sure if this is possible with how the game is designed).",Recommended,825,91.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

then there's the game play which is good. elden ring but with big guns and aggressive space bugs. the tyranids hate the ultramarine's after defeating two hive fleets so now you have to take out a teeny tiny fleet attacking a nearby world. after slaying them you fight your demon worshipping cousins the chaos marines who desire to burn down the emperors legacy :(
then you beat them in what feels like a great boss battle. i hate tzeench yet thank god there wasn't any real time demons i have had enough of bolt guns suffering with demons of tzeench. after that you get the grind game mode that doesn't feel bad to grind and there's also pvp which is peak. great game would recommend even on full price yet probably stay on standard unless your a die hard ultramarine fan.",Recommended,755,22.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

SPOILERS AHEAD...

Captain Lieutenant Demetrian Titus returns to my personal GOTY. If I was to sum up this game in short, it would be- that it reminds me of an Xbox 360 game. In every possible good sense. You have three modes. Campaign, PVE, and PVP, that's it. Almost no microtransactions. The game just works. No glaring optimization issues. It's just an all around solid game. But I'll get into the meat of the review now:

The Emperor Decides Our Fate, Gadriel

Saber Interactive picked up what Relic put down and turned the dial to 11. They expound on literally everything, while also making it extremely easy for somebody who knows nothing about 40k to understand. Titus' arc from the end of Space Marine 1 to the beginning of Space Marine 2 is amazing and lovely to someone who understands 40k lore (and especially to someone who cough mains Deathwatch cough). It is however, somewhat reminiscent of Space Marine 1, for good and bad. Orks Tyranids invade an important Imperial planet, they spend most of the campaign fighting them, go deeper and realize there is the same an artifact that is being hunted by Bloodletters the Thousand Sons, who end up being the real enemy all along. In terms of story, it should probably have been a bit different, but in terms of gameplay continuity, it makes sense, and expands the overall 40k lore because it is now official canon. However, the characters contained within the story are simply excellent and even tie into the miniatures directly, such as the new Captain of 2nd Company, whose mini you can literally buy off Games Workshop. Gadriel and Chairon, for being brand new side characters in a sea of lore, held up really well and successfully gave two individual and human arcs to two superhuman soldiers. Titus himself is ascending to a legendary figure status within the lore and is probably going to be the face of 40k to the masses.",Recommended,1742,13.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

There were challenging portions, but all I had to do was get better at the game. By the end I could pull off most parries and doges and knew how to switch between melee and ranged combat to best combat the heretical scourge. This game looks beautiful, is relatively lore accurate, and is fun.
The main issues with the game are that some bosses feel like they were well designed, but not designed with this games combat system in mind. (carnifex and helbrute) Another issue is that the combat system needs a little more depth for PVP to be something i desire to play regularly.
All in all it's worth buying, maybe wait for a sale.

76561198060366214,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060366214/,"All in all a good Game. Could be better, but quite good. I've only played Solo-Singleplayer so far.

Lorewise the Game is on Point. Multiple Moments where i was pleasantly surprised on how well Sabre followed 40K Lore. There are also a few nice Nods in the Direction of Dawn of War which were appreciated, showing that they did their homework very well.

Gameplay is what you expect. Hack and Slash, go through door, Shoot and Slash, go up the elevator, hack and slash while activating your power. The Weapon-choice is a bit bland in my opinion. Apart from a few heavy-weapons it's either Bolter that shoots fast, bolter that shoots slow, sniper-bolter. Plasma-Pistol and Plasma-Gun trivialize later bigger enemies a bit too much maybe. You can hunt for Data-Slates and sometimes you find Areas beside the main path that reward you with Weapons you can have 1-2 Missions earlier then the armory would grant them or Health-Pickups. Not enough to enourage secret-hunting, nor necessary. You'll start to look where the compass guides you, and try to go the other path for a little advantage maybe.
Heavy Weapons feel different and thus interesting, but you only pick them up and have them until they run out of ammo without a refill (Except for the Flamer). Not enough time to experiment and enjoy them to the fullest sadly.
Melee is better then in SM1. The parry-system feels rewarding, giving you a very much needed defensive tool that enables badassery right afterwards. The weapon-choices however are also not the most varied. Apart from Thunderhammer, everything kinda feels and fights the same.
The NPC Companions are passable. While they often leave Enemies stunned (most likely for you to regain shield) and forgett about finishing them off, they also sometimes don't prioritize important targets. You as the player have most often 2 jobs to fullfill on your own, which is stressfull. However, while sometimes they are not of much help, they never get in the way or need to be babysitted, which was a big relief.

The Game looks good. Cinematic visuals, Enemy design, you look and feel like a true space-marine, especially when fighting next to guardsmen. Doing overly violent and crazy stuff is part of the charm of the series and appreciated.
Also nice that i could play it on medium with my 8 year old rig, the optimization seems to be allright.

The Story itself is rather weak. While i am sure that people who are not deep into 40K Lore can enjoy this, Knowledge about the setting makes the experiance a lot better. Even better if you've also played the first game, otherwise you'll have a lot of ""What's going on? What is this? Who is it? What's a Primarch?"" moments. But even for those who have played the previous game, the very important question which lead to most of the events of the first game are talked about, but not resolved. Also, somehow, ""Palpatine"" is alive, undoing a lot of what we fought for in the first game. That plot-point is really weak and never explained to satisfaction which is a bit lazy. The Rest of the story you can forsee for a mile away. Especially if you've played the first game, because it's basically the same but a little weaker. Which is not good, as SM1 allready had a weak story.

The Characters are okay to good. Titus had a good chunk of character-development, torn between talking about his past and following orders, while dodging suspicion. It was also a very good choice to include the later antagonists, especially the deity they follow is perfect for making Titus question himself and his comrades constantly. It must be a tight corsett to write a Space-Marine Main-Protagonist while squeezing at least some relatable human emotions into it, without destroying the Angel of Death, that put's duty above else.
His two Companions try to establish banter between them, but it kinda falls a bit short. But that's okay, we're space Marines after all, the human side should be a bit clunky and underdeveloped. They have their moments and feel alive enough for me to accept them. The Rest of the Cast is rather flat however, one-dimensional and sufficing in their role, nothing more.

All in all, i would recommend. It's not groundbreaking, but a fun time to be sure.
While in some aspects i really do prefere it's predecessor, it's a good game",Recommended,3568,7.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The gameplay is pretty nice. Good gun combat, and even better melee combat.

The campaign is under 10 hours long. It's story is apparently pretty goofy according to warhammer fans. But, since I'm clueless about the lore, the lore inaccurate parts of the story just flew over my head.

The side operations are nice. But, there's only 6.
The PvP, even though noticeably underbaked, is still very enjoyable.
In total there's probably like 16 hours of non PvP content in the game right now.

This scratches the itch that helldivers' fall from grace left me with. The price made me wince a bit, but I think it was worth it. Especially if the game goes on sale, there's no doubt in my mind that it's worth your money.

Pros
+ Great combat system that feels meaty and powerful with excellent finishers that change with melee weapons.
+ Reasonable campaign length (9-10 hours) with a decent and engaging story.
+ In addition to the story there is a PvE operations (6 maps with more coming with seasonal content for free) and PvP eternal war mode. The operations link to the story well being an alternate squad mission objective.
+ Great and massive amount of enemies on screen thanks to the swarm system as per World War Z.

Cons
- The game has a varying number of issues and needs a lot of bug fixes. I get the waiting room bug for both story and eternal war game modes 99.9% of the time.
- The game takes a long time (up to a minute) to quit/close and only actually works 50% of the time with the remainder requiring you to end task the program.
- Experienced a number of small graphical glitches and instances where I could not interact with or pickup objects (e.g. Med stims).
- No widescreen monitor support on launch. Big faux pas and face palm from Saber Interactive.
- The parry system needs work and depending on the weapon is hard to use and inconsistent.

The skill unlock and weapon upgrade system is pretty good and if you have played World War Z then you will know it very well.",Recommended,1089,18.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.

Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.",Recommended,1404,69.6 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

This is one of the most fun games I have played in a while. It is just pure fun and joy with a HUGE side of gore and exploding Tyranids. If you are a Warhammer 40k fan this is a must buy and even if you aren't this is still a game that you should absolutely consider buying. Now I will admit I have been playing this game with my brother and dad so that is a huge part of the fun.

PvE: challenging but fun
PvP: .... to put this part of the game into perspective, imma break down the classes in a way most people can understand BASED ON MY Experience so far...

Tactical: Simple, not too complicated, gets the job done. your mentality is ""It ain't much, but its honest work""

Assault: you basically do what the vanguard does, but better, and have better respect because you actually prefer using your brain on how to position yourself or die trying rather than rely on cheap gimmicks.

Vanguard: if you unironically pick this class despite more respectable options being available, the only way you getting any respect is to understand you have more options on the battlefield than hiding around corners in order to stun lock people with a grapple hook, and a power kick....or relying on the bulwarks flashbangs for an easy kill.... you can actually use your other weapons, especially when your teammates getting pummeled on the objective...... meaning unless you actually use your weapons, and skills to support the team instead of going solely for cheap kills....your just a player who doesn't like taking risks.... your the noob tube from Cod4, the spawn camper in every game. you have no stones... and don't the astartes weigh like TONS in armor? what grapple cable can support their weight like that? it feels like a cheap knock off of fast PvP games like the more recent COD titles. despite my gripes with the classes abilities & how they're used, I will admit that helmet is HOT

Bulwark: for this you either fall into one of two categories:
A- you don't realize you actually HAVE weapons, and just use the shield
or
B- you do, and your the bane of the opposing team because of it XD

Sniper: not much to say beyond they do their part..... on the map with stairs, everywhere else is close quarters thus defeating the purpose of a sniper. A fancy scope doesn't mean much if the only range you can shoot at is POINT blank XD

Heavy: think of the heavy from TF2 if he could activate a bubble shield from halo that protects their front. if you get stuck 1v1 another heavy, the winner is determined based on who deployed their shield closest to death",Recommended,1812,20.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561198038293777,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038293777/,"For 40k fans, this game is a must-buy. If you're not a 40k fan, it's still a great game, and is likely to get you interested in the wider 40k universe.

Played on an MSI GE75 Raider with an RTX 2080 Super (Mobile) GPU and an Intel 10th gen i9-10980HK CPU. Game ran smoothly on high settings, albeit a little hot, averaging 88-90c while using the laptop's turboboost feature for its fans. When turboboost was turned off, it averaged 93c. For some reason the game runs hottest for me while in the armoury's customization screen. I didn't keep track of FPS but didn't notice any stutters.

Pro's:
-The story campaign is great.
-The PVE Operations are a great co-op experience.
-PVP is surprisingly fun.

Con:
-The story campaign is a bit short.
-There is only 6 PVE Operations, and increasing difficulty only increases the enemies health and their damage toward you, it does NOT increase the amount of enemies you fight. A BIG miss.
-PVP is 3 basic modes which all utilize the same 3 simple maps.
-Overall, the game feels under-cooked. What is here is mostly great, it just simply needs more of everything, as well as a revamp of the PVE difficulty modes.

Final thoughts: Based on the developer roadmap and comments, it looks like they have a lot more content planned for this game, which will be vital if they want this game to continue with a healthy player-base.
Regardless, if you plan on playing more than just the story campaign, this game is definitely worth a buy.",Recommended,1222,98.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The gameplay is honestly really punchy and satisfying, and the gunplay is not bad either, just maybe too weak in terms of damage. The Graphics are ofc awesome, and the cinematics are craaazy. I will say however, the ending was sort of cookie-cutter generic. It felt like the end of some Expendables movie that you SORTA liked only because it wasn't depressing garbage. Its just hard to root for the Empire after they'd been tormenting Titus the whole game. Overall though, 8/10. Would have preferred to buy on sale, but i have yet to experience the Co-op missions, or the PVP. As it stands the Campaign is about 8-10 hours long depending on how you play it, and while its a fun and interesting campaign, 10 hours is a bit short.

Space Marine 2 delivers fast-paced, brutal combat that’s a joy to play. The smooth switch between guns and melee feels great, and every hit has satisfying impact. It’s an adrenaline rush, especially in large-scale battles, with crisp visuals and chaotic action.

While the story takes a backseat and combat can feel a bit repetitive, the core gameplay shines. If you’re looking for an intense, action-packed shooter, this one’s a solid choice.

The multiplayer experience is where the game really extends its lifespan. PvE co-op lets you team up with friends to take on waves of enemies, testing your squad coordination against increasingly tougher challenges. It’s perfect for those who love the horde-style survival gameplay with intense, non-stop action. On the PvP side, the game offers competitive modes where you can clash with other players in team-based combat. Here, mastering both ranged and melee mechanics becomes essential, and the skill ceiling feels rewarding for players who want to dominate.

Both PvE and PvP are well-crafted, ensuring plenty of replayability and giving the game lasting appeal for players who thrive in online multiplayer environments.

HiFiveGuy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HiFiveGuy/,"It's a late 2000s era over-the-shoulder shooter with the quicktime events streamlined into dodging and parrying. It's not a deep story but it's fun to listen to. As a 40k fan, there's plenty of fan service and lots of customization options for multiplayer (even if the heretics didn't get the same love as a loyalists).

Gameplay is satisfying, scale and set-dressing are marvelous, game feels like a complete experience that didn't overstay its welcome. If you're a fan of the setting or liked playing either Uncharted or Gears of War back in High School then this game is for you.

To bastardize a quote from the legend TB back in 2011. It's Ultramarines and they're very boring but nothing beats the visceral thrill of cleaving through hordes of xenos and rhythmic chug of a bolter.

unrealdx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/unrealdx/,"Overall love the game there are just a few issues in my opinion with the parry/dodge system (like hitting parry and it feeling like it doesn't parry some times and when aiming down sights which the default is middle mouse you can't parry, dodge or melee when you need to unless you hit the middle mouse again to get out of it which is dumb). Also at the moment if you try and switch gamemodes (go into PvE or PvP) it will put you into matchmaking which is annoying af when you're just trying to look at stuff (customization, skills, loadouts, etc.). You have to quickly cancel matchmaking before it can send you into a match.

Campaign is amazing but a little short, I hope we get some campaign dlc added in the future.

PvE I feel is unbalanced. There are 4 difficulties: Minimal, Average, Substantial and Ruthless. I have only beaten Minimal (which is easy and pretty fun but seems to have gotten harder) and Average (kinda hard but doable) difficulties. I believe I played Substantial once which was impossible due to it spawning basically a special enemy (basically a mini boss but it doesn't have a visible health bar) that is very hard to fight on it's own and a mini-boss (with a visible health bar) (this has also happened on Average difficulty but we were able to handle it). The biggest issue is a certain level of item you can only get on the higher difficulties that you need in order to level up your weapons which is armory data. You need 1 Master-Crafted, 1 Artificer and 1 Relic for every weapon in the game. Basically when you level up a weapon it hits a roadblock that you need the armory data to unlock then you can get more powerful versions of the weapon.

PvP is generally annoying in my opinion. There are 3 game modes: Seize Ground (Domination where there are 3 static flags that need to be captured for points over time. Basically wherever you spawn you get the closest flag, the better team gets the middle flag and you keep swapping spawns stealing the outer flags). Capture and Control (Hardpoint where there is an area that moves around the map after a certain amount of time where players stand in order to get points or if both teams are present no one gets points. Annoying when no one plays the objective or when you keep getting put on low level/skill teams constantly.... the only mode I play because I'm decent but can't get kills and stay alive at the same time). Finally Annihilation (Team Deathmatch kill enemy players to get points.... never played because I can rarely get a positive Kill/Death ratio).

The biggest thing there are 6 classes (for now, they plan on apparently adding more in the future), to get all the cosmetics for each class you need 40 wins either in PvE or PvP matches (so overall 240 wins). PvE matches are kinda long and can get repetitive since there are only 6 and you might not like to replay some missions (1 in particular has an objective you need to move by standing by it then when necessary press buttons to rotate it and some people don't know what they are doing making it very annoying). While with PvP you are stuck with trying to find teams that can win and having to stay in lobbies with those winning teams (I tend to cancel matchmaking if I end up in a lobby with more than 1 level 10+ on the enemy team and more than 1 level 5 or under on my team. There have been some good low level players, there had been some bad high level players but overall I don't like getting stuck in matches where we lose 50 or less.... including 0 to 200 or being always like 20 points behind the enemy dragging out a losing battle forever).",Recommended,2943,82.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

AstorathTheGrim,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AstorathTheGrim/,"Pros

1. Great story and writing through the campaign and operations.

2. Amazing back ground buildings and model details that capture the Warhammer 40k universe to its core.

3. Graphics are Superb and highly detailed.

4. Gameplay feels responsive and fluid. Very well done.

Cons

1. Game is not alt tab friendly and crashes game, atleast in my experience.

2. Game sometimes times out at certain points and disconnects you randomly. To be fair it's probably from server traffic overloads with player connecting to server since the game is new.

3. Needs more game modes and customization options at this point but, the game has more game mode types and enemies in development with a road map to show what the devs are working on with a timeline.

4. Armour feels like tissue paper and may need to be reworked a bit or give health back with armour on executions like in the first space marine game. Only getting armour back isn't fun when it doesn't even feel like armour when playing campaign or operations. I feel the first space marine game had a great system for staying in the fight and making it more fun and enjoyable in combat. It would make campaign and operations more fun and enjoyable but, leave the armour and health system alone for the Eternal Crusade pvp mode as it is as I think it is well balanced for pvp and needs no rework.

Other than the few Cons the game is great and I think it is game of the year material.
Even with the issues it does have I give the game 10/10.",Recommended,1233,81.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

As a huge Warhammer 40K nerd, reading the many Adeptus Astartes books, playing the table top itself, another Space Marine game hits home. Its Beautiful, it makes you feel like you are the Space Marine. The Operations plays like a Vermintide, Darktide, Gears of War if all three had a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up Orgy and this is what we got. The game shines on the darkness of the Imperium, for some folks that don't know Warhammer 40K is set in a Grim, Dark, Dangerous time in the 41st millennium where there are different races of aliens, humans fighting eachother for galactic dominance. The Adeptus Astartes have dark stories of genocide, being heroes to the Imperium, slaughtering heretics with Power Fists, 19mm handguns to put holes into your foes. Your Space Marine in Operations or Eternal War can be customized to your liking. (My Space Marine is customized to match my Space Wolves that I run in real life in Table Top.)

76561198046450669,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046450669/,"The best description I've heard for this game is that ""it's like playing Bloodborne in a mosh pit."" Space Marine 2 is pulling ideas from all over the place so of course it decided to meld the swarm-based enemies of the original game with Soulborne-style melee mechanics that require timing and finesse. As much as I find good parry mechanics satisfying, paying attention to an enemy's attacks becomes a bit of a chore when approximately 50,000 clones of the same bugger are simultaneously trying to claw their way into my butt hole. So I wouldn't say Space Marine 2 offers a refined experience, however I would say that it is a perfect popcorn game. Big, serious men talk about honor and duty while wearing armor that looks designed by a second grader with half a pack of crayons. Plot that's both convoluted and simplistic. Combat that's a few zip codes away from balanced but at least is too chaotic to get samey. Performance at first was worrisome- I experience pop-ups galore and the camera decided to take periodic coffee breaks while I was taking on a boss that looked like a cockroach with mantis blades and a bad attitude. This has gotten mostly better, although the jank now might approach Bethesda-levels of entertaining, like when I stood for 30 seconds watching one of my squad mates stand in a corner hopping up and down like he was doing the pee-pee dance.

Steam Deck performance: Will start, and is actually manageable when the game is in tight corridors, but as soon as it opens up to sky boxes and swarms becomes very prone to crashing. If you manage to get it running with no problems for more than 30 minutes remember to thank the Emperor.",Recommended,1367,4.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the game-play was not really clicking for me. I found fighting the warriors really un-fun and if you have played any of this game, you'll know that's a problem. It felt like I was playing wrong, but I couldn't really figure out what I wasn't doing right.I have a feeling if you were really into 40K it would probably be more enjoyable, but as someone who has only casually engaged with the universe, it's not really hitting the way I was expecting. I would have given it a bit more time, but I wanted to get my refund before the time ran out. Maybe I just had to get gud, but it was already getting a bit repetitive 1.5 hours in.

For what it's worth, the game runs really well for my PC and it's genuinely impressive when you see the huge swarms coming.

This game is a blast. Fast Paced Combat, Blood and Guts, a decent variety of enemies, and good story line. The difficulty isn't too high. On normal its pretty balanced. For an average gamer like me it gives a challenge, but if you are a fast fingered pro at these types of games you will probably want to bump up the difficulty a bit.

If your PC can handle the Ultra graphics, it is a beautiful game at 1440p. I lowered the settings down to medium to see how they looked, and its still very nice. You do need to be able to hold a steady 60FPS or I feel the game would be hard to play.

Also I will throw out there some of the battle cinematic are epic. A particular one at what I am assuming is near the end of the game gave me chills.

I did receive this game for free by purchasing an AMD CPU. But I would have gladly paid the price for the game. I'm 8 and half hours in and feeling like I am nearing the end.

The co-op, while also far from perfect, is a great start with good progression and pretty solid balance (as long as you are running difficulty appropriate missions) while also unlocking awesome cosmetics.

MatthewRoot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MatthewRoot/,"I just finished the game and I'm absolutely blown away. This game is everything I could ever wish from a Warhammer game. If you are a fan of linear shooters or action games in general, this game is a must-play. It's bloody, brutal and violent, full of spectacle and badass moments, where you feel like an absolute god of the battlefield.

The combat takes a while to get used to, but once you do, oh boi does it feel good to skewer and rip the Xenos open with the power of your fists alone or with the help of an iconic chainsword. The weight of the Space Marines is so perfectly conveyed, you can feel every step, every shot, every punch and the power it carries. The enemies are varied and force you to play around them differently based on their type and abilities, adding quite a nice tactical aspect into the combat.

The environments are insanely detailed, the atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking at times, the views are staggering. Graphic wise, this game is a feast for your eyes. It's honestly amazing how faithful the game is to it's source material and how well it managed to recreate the Warhammer universe and it's vibe to the smallest detail. Especially the armors and the different chapter designs and decals *chefs kiss*, the amount of customization you can do with this is amazing.

Apart from the visuals I think the sound design also deserves a big heads-up. Not only environmental and character / weapon sounds, but also music and at times stunning voice acting really helped to sell the situations and the characters.

Content wise, I'd say the campaign was well paced, with good variety and long enough to be fullfilling without overstaying its welcome and becoming stale. Coop works really well, your friends can basically join you at any point of any mission, so it's quite seemless. Multiplayer also seems to be quite fun from a little bit I've tried so far.

If I had to list some gripes I have with the game, it would be:
- slight problems with optimization here and there, where we couldn't load in the middle of a mission
- story might be quite confusing for people who haven't played the 1st one or don't know any Warhammer lore
- enemies in the 2nd half get a little bit repetitive after a while

In the end this is exactly my type of jam. I freaking love this. Absolutely phenomenal, fun, run and gun, balls to the walls story full of spectacle, explosions, gunfire, xenos blood and unbreakable brotherhood. 8/10 would server the Emperor again.

tramilton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tramilton/,"Peak Warhammer experience. Campaign on the shorter end (12-15 hours maybe? I was afk a bunch and played some of the PvE mood too) but the PvE mode (kinda like horde shooter a la Darktide) and PvP mode gives the game more longevity depending on your tastes.

Unfortunately it suffers from the exact same mistake they did with the first game. Lets you fight fun faction first (orks/tyranids) then makes the boring faction to fight the mainstay at the end of the story (Chaos Spacemarines).

Like seriously, ♥♥♥♥ the shielded tzaangors and termie's rocket spam that can clip through terrain you tried to use for cover.

76561199133162180,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199133162180/,"Initial Thoughts -

Campaign - Short and somewhat mediocre. With the fantastic stories of 40k, having a re-run of Space Marine 1 story arc was not it. Pacing is all over the place but with some fun moments here and there. Seeing Tyranids is very nice to see however small they may be compared to the stories presented in the novels and books, Hardware limitations be damned. Overall a solemn 6.5/10.

However.... the gameplay, is very fun and satisfying. Strong sound design with the Bolter weaponry aswell as the meaty slams of the hammer and energy power up from the power sword makes for some great presentation and weight. Parrying is a bit of an issue as the philosophy of relying on color'd reactions is not always reliable as looking at what your parrying by the animation of the enemy. This gives a false sense of reaction timing at times which leads to some somewhat irritating encounters.

The aesthetic and world building is unmatched only slightly above what was the champion - Darktide. In a Galaxy filled to the brim of wars that are constant and brutal, this gives the best sense of it. Hive cities are truly gargantuan and the Jungle/Rural landscapes that seperate the Factory/Church feel give a very welcome feel.

Operations are super solid with some interesting class choices that at times feel somewhat lack luster. The 6 missions you do are great... but drag on as you play them on and on and on and on. The customization is prolly my favorite part of Op as it gives me the Table top feel of painting my own miniatures. Sally and Death Guard enjoyer here!

PvP is prolly the most 2010 3rd person fps I've felt in a long time. Imagine Gears of War but with the classes of Op, and then put those two formula's into Deathmatch or King of the Hill. Pretty much self explanatory. with only 3 maps tho makes for underwhelming amount of content.

Overall I'm happy for this game as I personally did not have many technical issues. This game however is clearly unfinished and was pushed to make date and time. I love the polish that is in the game and overall its very fun!

It needs more content to provide that full price tag.

If you are a 40k fanatic you will have already gotten the game like I have.

If you are considering getting this game, understand that what is offered is fun but will last you only so long before it may become meh for you.

My recommendation is either get it right now for those who understand what they want out of this game, Big men in Power Armor Killing alien and xenos alike and enjoying it or wait and see what content is added to the game in the coming months.

Consider the Road map and may the Emperor guide you to Great Games as always!",Recommended,2211,16.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

the game its self is a solid foundation with good game play good graphics and a really cool enemy horde system, however this game is very hollow, the space marines have a very lack lustre skill tree with only 8 skills aloud to be selected, running is slow, reloading is slow unless you execute,
the timing to dodge parry can be confusing with the ""Qs' being to early or not sounded at all, very inconsistent,
upon completion of the campaign which if you are a Warhammer fan like i am is actually amazing, great story some good lore, the campaign is well done its once you finish apart from levelling up all 6 classes which some have no real point there is very little left to do there no real looting its more just kill a boss of find armoury data once per map, pretty pointless, the RPG elements also pretty pointless because how little there are, and weapon selecting is really bad basically only tactical class has access to majority weapons, leaving other classes again underwhelming,

they need to add a round based shooter similar to zombies, it would suit this game, also, give us double bolters etc give all characters all 3 weapon slots, bring in all the weapons i cannot stress it enough the selection is so bad, there is alot that needs to be done to this game to make it a banger however it is at the core a very solid game, if they listen to feed back add weapons to classes build on skill tree and add round based with actual loot to be extracted maybe to be crafted into armour this would dramatically increase replay-ability all in all it is a good game that needs work but if you like Warhammer i do recommend it, my complaints come from being a Warhammer fan mainly.",Recommended,1512,99.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

redrapptor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/redrapptor/,"Absolute must play for anyone interested in 40k, no question. Even if you're not, if you've ever enjoyed games like Helldivers, Doom, or Gears of War, you'll likely love this too. Play the original Space Marine from 2011 while you're at it, still holds up very well and you'll get a lot more out of the sequel if you play it first.

All this game needs right now is more maps for PvP, more game modes for PvP, armor customization for Heretic Astartes, and, above all else, an option to play the PvP mode with a cross-platform party. Right now the game refuses to let you enter the PvP mode with anyone playing on another platform for ""balance"" reasons, but you are still randomly matched with players from all platforms anyway so it's a completely pointless restriction that does not actually prevent crossplay from happening, it only prevents you from playing with your friends across platforms. At the very least, it should be an option to opt into completely unrestricted PvP where anyone can party up and be matched with anyone regardless of platform or balance concerns.

From a Game Designers perspective the main mechanic is the same with some few improvements. I like the additional upgrades you get to take advantage of in Co-Op and Multiplayer. I think they should come out with a Chaos Space Marine title that follows some of the story line of a Chaos Space Marine similar to Titus.

bluetrazyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bluetrazyn/,"Ah space marine 2... a fantastic game, but don't expect too much or you will be very disappointed.

The moment to moment gameplay is excellent. The story is great (the actions of certain characters don't make any sense, but hey that's typical in 40k). Sound design is excellent.

HOWEVER:

1. The 6 missions in the co-op pve mode wear thin quickly. There is a ton of customization and progression across 6 different characters (which is AWESOME) but there is simply not enough here to reach level 25 without content getting extremely repetitive. If you continue increasing the difficulty as you level up, one levelup occurs every 1-2 missions. There are 6 total missions. That means 50 victories to max level. So to max out ONE class, you would end up playing each mission EIGHT TIMES (if you spread it out evenly).

2. The operations mode at higher difficulties are very unbalanced and break all immersion. It's very challenging for the wrong reasons. Small fodder shred through ceramite power armor and sponge up multiple bolter shots (this applies even if your character is the recommended level for substantial/ruthless difficulty).

3. The campaign ends with a cliffhanger/sequel bait. Again. Hopefully we won't have to wait another 11 years for the next one!

All in all, a GOOD game worth your time/money. Definitely better than the first. However, don't go into it expecting a Dan Abnett novel in video game form. 40k video games have yet to hit their stride.",Recommended,1227,19.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561198380239898,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198380239898/,"By the Emperor's grace and the will of the Omnissiah, I have traversed the battlefield of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and as a loyal servant of the Imperium, I offer my review from the trenches of battle. Let it be known that this game, forged in the crucible of our most hallowed lore, stands as a testament to our unyielding might.

From the outset, the game immerses you in the grimdark reality of the 41st millennium. The weight of the Power Armour, the unyielding resolve of the Emperor’s finest, and the relentless tide of xenos and heretics have been captured with a level of fidelity that befits the legacy of the Adeptus Astartes.

The environments are a reverent homage to the desolate war-torn worlds we are accustomed to. The visuals are a masterful depiction of ruin and decay, as though the very rubble of forgotten bastions and the smog of burning hive cities have been rendered with an artist's touch. The power and majesty of our Chapter's armor is showcased in all its splendor, each detail reflecting the sacredness of our wargear and the grim determination etched into our souls.

The combat in Space Marine 2 is a symphony of brutality and precision. The melee mechanics have been honed to a razor’s edge, allowing us to cleave through foes with righteous fury. The bolter’s roar is as satisfying as ever, and the newly enhanced weaponry feels as though it has been forged in the fires of Mars itself. The enemies you face are varied and numerous, from the grotesque horrors of the Tyranids to the cunning schemes of the heretic, each demanding a different strategy and relentless perseverance.

The narrative is a grim reminder of the eternal struggle we endure. The story unfolds with the gravitas fitting of our Imperium's eternal crusade. It does not shy away from the stark realities of war, the sacrifices made, or the unyielding will required to endure. The voice acting and script serve as a rallying cry for those who heed the Emperor's call, and the sense of camaraderie and duty is palpable.

For those who thrive in the crucible of war, Space Marine 2 offers a range of challenges that would make even the most seasoned veteran break a sweat. The difficulty settings ensure that even the most battle-hardened of us will find ourselves tested, with every victory a testament to our skill and dedication.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 stands as a worthy continuation of our storied legacy. It honors the tradition of our Chapter and the Imperium, offering a battle experience that is both exhilarating and true to our grimdark universe. To the Emperor’s chosen, this game is not merely a pastime; it is a call to arms, a celebration of our eternal vigilance, and a reminder of the darkness we fight against. For those who seek to wield the power of the Astartes and defend the Imperium with valor, this game is a beacon of our indomitable spirit.

In the name of the Emperor, I commend this title to those who walk the path of the warrior. Remember, brothers and sisters, to play with honor, and may our enemies tremble at our might.

Although I personally didn't like it (and refunded it), I can still recommend this game. It's an extremely solid experience, no doubt. Space Marine 2 does a great job of being a simple, yet dumb fun power-fantasy shooter to play with friends. With adjustments in the settings, the game runs fine and it's easy to drop in and join your friends.

However, I will say Space Marine 2 has a variety problem. Now, admittedly, I'm not familiar with the Warhammer Universe at all, so maybe I have the untrained eye to notice certain things... but to me, nearly all the enemies fight/look the same and the guns you use feel/look the same. Although there is some enemies/guns that are unique, every arena and fight seems to be the same, outside of three/four exceptions. The combat is also very simplistic, as your arsenal/movement is: one pistol, one rifle, 3 grenades, a melee, and a roll (and a jetpack if you pick a class that has it).

Again, it's still a good game, but I think that catch is, at least for me, is the 59.99 USD price tag; it doesn't feel like I'm getting a whole lot for the price. Although I did not finish the campaign, it seems like it's only 10 hours long (judging from word of mouth). The PvE mode seems a little unbaked, as there's only 6 missions that play very similarly. The PvP is actually quite fun, but there's only 3 maps.

So, just to conclude: good game, just not worth 60 dollars for what it currently offers in my opinion. However, if you are on the fence, I'd wait for a Steam sale as this game is definitely worth getting with a reduced price tag.",Recommended,1309,3.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

66Sykez,https://steamcommunity.com/id/66Sykez/,"hands down my favorite 40K game sofar
the story was short, but incredibly hype (even if the end somewhat deviates from the lore, but it was sick, so i wasn't bothered by it)
the pve is basically the same as the campaign gameplay wise, just with your own custom spacemarine
the combat is responsive, the guns feel weighty like bolt weapons should, the different melee weapons cover all the types between fast, medium and slow and my god the executions, they really never get old
but the gamemode i did not expect to be enjoying the most has been pvp, sure there's only 3 gamemodes and 3 maps (there are more gamemodes coming according to the roadmap and i do hope that they start adding more maps aswell), but there's just something about it that i can't put my finger on. i'm not usually a pvp enjoyer especially with shooters, but this one feels different.

some things i would like to see added/changed in the future:
-at the very least heretic customisation
if it were up to me, the heretic classes would not be restricted to a class per chapter and i assume because of how it is now is why emperors children and thousand sons are missing (maybe one day we'll get 2 more classes and see those chapters added) i do know full chapter representation per heretic chapter is no small ask
-the currency to unlock perks in pve should not be the same as the currency you use to unlock customisation options (while i don't like the idea of currency bloat, i like having to choose progression over fashion less)
-the matchmaking in both pve and pvp is kinda bad atm
in pve your squad of 3 needs 3 unique classes and when starting a mission the game asks you what class you want to play, so i don't understand why the game will continuously match you with people playing the same class which ends in either a staredown until someone caves and switches to a different class or you leave the lobby to look for a new one
in pvp it's not about who you're getting matched with, but the fact that after a match you stay in the lobby and immediately start the countdown for a new match unless you're quick enough to leave the lobby to not go straight into the next match. at first i didn't think much of it until i wanted to swap game modes after a match, but the timer which is usually roughly 60 seconds now started at like 5 seconds once i loaded into the hub (fun fact: at 4 or 5 seconds you can no longer leave the lobby) so you're essentially forced to either play another match or alt f4/quit out of the match after it starts (which i've seen happen and ended in us playing 4v6)
if you do end up able to quit the lobby and start matchmaking for a different game mode, sometimes the matchmaking will just die and you have to return to the main menu and load in again

despite its current issues, i do really really enjoy this game
it is incredibly fun, aside from the one rule of cool moment at the end of the campaign, it is incredibly faithful to the source material and there is so much potential for future content, i can't wait to see what everything on the road map turns out to be

infinityGrom,https://steamcommunity.com/id/infinityGrom/,"So, I played this since release, main story (solo) and operations (PvE). Here is why I liked it:

GAMEPLAY. In both modes it feels like a slasher-shooter, and it's quite satisfying to do both. On higher difficulties tactics becomes quite important, now your team has to pick certain types of weapons. Bots are stupid, they do two things good - they kinda shoot and they rush to revive you, so for higher difficulties you are better off with other players. I am yet to see how the game looks like in coop (main story, operations will be called PvE) when you play anyone but Titus (sorry for spoiler but it isn't a spoiler, he is even on a banner in Steam). But for now, lets talk weapons. I was looking forward to try power fist in the story mode but sadly it's absent, and since the discovery of power sword I can't play anything else, I like it too much. As for the guns, Titus isn't limited by any class and can use just any weapon, pick yours, I liked Bolter Rifle (with grenade launcher, when possible) and a heavy bolter pistol. Speaking of which, I am very disappointed that it's absent from most of the classes in PvE, I would expect someone like Bulwark who doesn't have a ranged rifle to be able to access it but no :( Guns do feel different, and I especially like how they sound and just annihilate anything small. Enemies have a variety and are very well gradually introduced, though closer to end of a main story it kinda exhausts, and outside of unique bosses for PvE there aren't any new enemies that you can encounter several times per level.

GRAPHICS. Note: played this game on QHD 60 fps quite stable on 1080 Ti + 1950X Threadripper. The amount of details in this is crazy. Every mission you get a scene where there is a lot of units in a distance running/fighting, and if the background is Imperial you get this Gothic cathedrals, high spires and everything, it looks amazing. Also nothing beats an actual swarm of Tyranids running towards you, you understand that no matter how many bullets you sink into them, it is the question of when you would have to go in melee. And customization, oh my lord. Though the interface is a bit clumsy, you can get a feel of it. You can actually change parts of costume and their coloring, guess next step would be attaching new components and custom emblems, it's not there yet. I am quite happy running as Salamander/Raven Guard in PvE.

BUGS: I encountered only minor bugs and one disconnection while I was AFK. I got Tassets (yes, I googled it) flying and clippling though arms in a cutscene and a game for a bit, I think restart fixed that. Then I got two times when characters were lagging behind on the elevator, one time that was in PvE. And rather recent, I seem to have a delay to the victory music after each PvE mission which gets progressively worse the more I play. Either that happened due to a long session or something else - I don't know, will come back if fixed now.

SOUND. Music hits in the moment, but sadly I don't think I would like to hear it outside of the game. It works inside the game though. Sound design is just amazing! You hear the heavy footsteps of Space Marine, their jumps, bolters firing sounds like a heavy weapon, slashing sounds good too. It just clicks. I have to admit, in a heat of battle it can be quite hard to understand some characters over the vox filter and you don't quite have time to read the subtitles but other than that it is very solid.

OPERATIONS (PvE). Even though they are designed as main campaign rather corridor-like, it doesn't make them bad. There is still quite a lot happening and these levels aren't used in main campaign, variety allows you to take a break of some missions to enjoy other ones. Replay value is good, stuff on the map is placed differently (aside from datapads, a.k.a. audio logs) but the levels are premade, after few runs you would memorize them. The classes have quite some customisation, both for cosmetics and for weapons. You get character perks, you get weapon perks, you get weapon rarity which allows to change their cosmetics too. My issue with this is locking 1 class for 1 player. Had to stare as someone joined into my lobby to pick the same class as me and then wait for them to stand in armory for 5 minutes, didn't got enough votes to kick (me and 1 other player were standing in the launch area at this point). So, please remove this, I know that having 3 bulwarks sounds stupid yet I want to be able to try it. If balance is your concern, add this to private lobbies only so that you can only do that on purpose.

STORY. You don't need to know anything about the universe or the previous game, the game does explanation very well. Read quite some criticism on this point but I liked it. I know a bit about Warhammer 40K lore so, to me it was enjoyable and understandable, I quite liked how the story was done. Yes, it may seems as generic battle brothers saving the world, but in this Universe for Space Marines that's everyday, sometimes many times a day. Spoiler alert!!! Feel free to finish on this. I liked how your squadmates grow with Titus, first trying to get to know him, later throwing out words like ""The Codex Astartes does not support this type of action... But I am looking forward to it"". Quite a pun to previous game, especially hours or days after he suggested to reanimate ancient ship that's wrecked and send it ramming xenos structure, Imperial Navy approves. Okay this is getting long - so two more things that I noticed and liked. First is that PvE missions have a story, with 5 of them going parallel to the main storyline! And it's not like some simple tasks: go kill an enemy general to disorient them, blow up an fuel field and cook enemy swarm that was going after main target or get to that ship wreck and reanimate it! The immense scale of Warhammer 40K goes even into them. Oh, by the way, the levels for PvE missions are unique, not the same as in main story. And the last bit, the story bit. I was shell shocked when I realized that Tzeench's followers first killed Archmagos, then allowed us to retrieve his pupil (they were trying to get him too, but that's like a win-win for them. If they succeeded than they would get his knowledge, if not) so that we would send him to the power source to the planet where it can be used and then tricking Magos to turn it on himself! And then launch a full-scale invasion on it, catching Imperium off-guard. Honestly, if not for Titus and his squad's unorthodox tactics that battle would have been lost for the Imperium. So I think writers did very well on that part, shows how terrifying Tzeench can be with his intrigues.",Recommended,5437,27.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

76561198108641985,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198108641985/,"I love this game. At release its far from perfect but I still highly recommend it especially to fans of warhammer. I try to avoid spoilers as much as i can but there are a few in the latter half of the cons portion.

Pros:
Fun combat
looks great
Good customization for loyalist marines in multiplayer
A good amount of content in a campaign, coop pve, and 6v6 pvp
Enjoyable story (with stipulations see cons)

Cons:
Multiplayer
matchmaking is not great often teams are very lopsided and fairly unreliable connection. not to mention just not connecting in the first place resulting in a hard lock on the game requiring an alt f4 or task manager to get out of.
There is only 3 maps for multiplayer not per game mode just three maps period. the lack of variety in the maps is very noticeable after really only a couple of matches
Many quality of life features are simply not in the game yet. You straight up can't see what the multiplayer game modes are just the titles of the game modes. you cant switch game modes with out automatically queuing up for a match unless you select the game mode and then press escape to exit out of it which is very jarring when you are first doing multiplayer and just annoying once you get used to it.

Main campaign is fun and enjoyable but lacking in a couple ways.
First it does not break up the game play loop so while the combat is very fun it is just combat save for exactly two short portions in the entire campaign. This makes a lot of the campaign while still very fun a bit forgettable in my opinion.
Second the story while relatively engaging feels too short and unfinished. Many things are introduced and then just not touched on ever again or very little. it feels like it needed to almost twice as long to more neatly go into most of the things it covers.
***Spoilers***
They just drop the tyranids half way through. like you don't beat them you don't win against them just thousand sons show up and basically almost immediately never deal with them again. which makes no sense cuz while chaos showing up is a big deal its still a TYRANID invasion ♥♥♥♥ really can't be ignored and you straight up don't learn what happened to it. Now the thousand sons are another issue they get disrespected for the most part getting very little opportunity to actually show their stuff and express their personality as a legion. When their finally revealed they just show up and say nothing. their is only a single one of them that really has much of any character and they to just show up out of nowhere not foreshadowed at all. like he is cool but is just their acting like hes been talking with the player for the whole campaign.

To summarize and explain my feelings on this game:
I love this game. I think its an awesome and very fun game but also very clearly under baked and feels rushed in nearly every aspect. despite these short comings the game still manages to earn a strong recommendation from me with the fair warning of its incompleteness at release. If i'm being objective its like a 6 or 7/10. but in my very biased opinion its a solid 8/10 for me that with time (and hopefully more complete) can easily become a 9/10.",Recommended,2600,28.9 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

While I would not say it is extremely innovative or perfect (Minor gripes of parry and dodge mechanics, of which I believe could have been implemented better) it has all the trappings of a dam good game. Overall combat is solid, while the audio immersion and graphic quality are up there as well. Story is simple but told extremeley well, and while some of the more fancy twists of the story require some passing knowledge of the previous title, its just as easy for new fans too jump in and get the gist of whats going on rather quickly. Multiplayer PvE modes are reminiscent of Gears of War minus the Horde mod (Which I think would have been a excellent addition). PvP is fun though I would not say I have enough hours too say if its balanced or all that great. Overall its well worth the price point and I would give it a 8/10, does it blow me away, no.

It was a joy to witness the imperial guard in action and see the tanks and aircraft. Story was alright, not the best but not the worst. I did enjoy the reveals at the end, but the campaign feels like it ends abruptly.

Melee and Gunplay are a joy in PvE
PvP needs a lot of work.

Operations (the co-op 3 player custom marine mode) is wonderful to play though I do think they need to remove the marines names so you don't get broken out of immersion constantly.

MATCHMAKING IN PVE NEEDS TO BE FIXED - I constantly get qued into the highest difficulty as my class and have to pick a different one i dont have at level. This is BAD for me and BAD for my team.

However, you absolutely need an SSD at bare minimum. also, there are some TERRIBLE server issues that the game is currently facing. I highly recommend this game.. AFTER the server issues are fixed.

kesendaran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kesendaran/,"The game is good, but infuriating and if the setting didn't appeal to me because of all the over-the-top bullshittery going on all the time, this game isn't doing it any favours either.

*light spoilers ahead* DISCLAIMER: I kinda suck and am still getting used to the controls.

-Tried controller. Great to survive and kill stuff. Horrible to control the camera. When I play FPS games with controller I play with inverted Y axis. This is a mixture of FPS and 3rd person, which confuses my brain and it keeps shifting between the mindset of playing with normal axis and inverted axis, making me often see the battlefield from the top instead, especially when using melee attacks.
- Jetpack mission. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THE SNIPERS SO TANKY? I SMASH ONTO THEM FROM 60 FEET ABOVE AND THEY STILL NEED A ♥♥♥♥ TON OF DAMAGE TO DIE!
- Flying tyrannids can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves with a pine tree.
- the mission with the rippers and the flamethrower was extremely confusing. Was expecting the AI guys to keep me covered while I dealt with the rippers. Nope. Got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sideways 3 ways to hell, before I could eventually get a grip and survive.
- How the ♥♥♥♥ do Speesh Marooons survive with such weak weapons at their disposal? Seriously.
- 3 hours into the game and I've seen more dead Space Marines than alive ones. How can this setting still be a thing if they die by the dozen really? Don't even mention the Cadians and all the other squishy humans out there. My brain can't compute at the moment.
- Questions, tons of questions.


Compared to DOOM 2016, this game is very confusing in its gameplay, when it requires you to make quick decisions. Enemy attacks sometimes are very similar but require diferent methods to be dealt with. I swear I've seen the same attack be a red and a blue circle at different times, which makes it really hard to predict what the enemies are doing.

If this is what being in that setting means, they got it right. But as a videogame, it needs some polish, I feel. But I'm also not used to these types of games, so.... salty much. Still recommend, as I think it's worth a try, but reeaaaally depends on your tastes in games.",Recommended,1765,6.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Campaign is a lot of fun, you learn a lot about the character from before SM1, and how he came to be what he was. But I personally loved the PvP and how it isn’t just shooting others but also a touch of strategy in what you’re doing.

Overall, I would say it’s a solid 7 or 8/10, mainly because of some bugs and it still being new, but this game definitely has a lot of potential that it hasn’t touched on",Recommended,589,14.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

hamordrex,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hamordrex/,"As a fan of anything warhammer, this is it.

For the environment : The attention to details is amazing and beyond this world. The way they did battlefields is amazing with the hordes of tyrannids rushing to devour their prey. Even going in corridors or small players you can look around and see a story being told through was looks like last stands, lost fights and such. Even walking into adeptus mechanicus areas, you can see the grim dark flowing through through one of these servitor lining up the wall to control the air conditioner.

For the lore : Good attention to details, all the units seems like a living model from the board game. All the loyalists factions act like they should be in the lore and it's amazing that not much has been modified to fit in the ''modern audience'' . Only thing I wish was for Pink horrors to show up. Would it not be amazing to have them separate into blue horrors if you don't execute them fast enough?

For the game overall : The gameplay is amazing, I like the parry system and it always feel like you're STRUGGLING to survive any encounter. It can get really high intensity and you have to use the proper gun/tools sometimes to survive. My only complaints is that I wish the imperial guards AI would be better. If you look at them mid fight they will just stand there doing nothing ( I wish they would go behind cover or even flee if the hormagaunts are approching. ) .

I Wish there was more horrific ends to the humans as the lore is pretty crazy regarding the weapons of the termagaunts : they can shoot some short of high velocity beetles called fleshborers. Their short lives are simply to dig through armor and dig inside their victim causing the most damage. Would have been crazy to see stuff like this like in The Mummy movie ( the beetle going to the brain scene )

Also wish there was more variations of the finishers, they really lack diversity compared to games like doom eternal.

Final comments :

Really glad these developer kept the game highly respectful to the lore and the WH40K universe. The characters are masculine, no woke messaging and it's just about completing the missions and winning the war.

The duo of marines with Titus are not 1 dimentionals and critique properly Titus when needed. But it's not long winded conversations : They state a question or a comment, the other argues back or answers, then after a quick settling they focus back to their mission ( no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ).

BTW learn to parry. You can parry anytime, even during an attack animation. Do it vs everything but ranged attacks, and you won't die.

The PvP is broken. You'll die of frustration from a thousand cuts. :
- You can't chat until you've spawned. You can't chat with the enemy. You can't emote either.
-
- You must die to change class. Get it? You'll be owned by any premades who get to decide who does what.
- There's no balance at all. ALL games I've played were teams of newbies vs teams of people that quadruple them in levels.
- And there is no player shuffling, so you'll either leave the match, or play again with the same skill disparity. Get bored or get owned.

EDIT: Should've talked about The Feel. You don't feel like a big, chunky, genetically engineered human being that weights a ton and a half. You feel like a normal person, and the actually human infantry feel like hobbits with guns.

Ever played For Honor? For all its flaws, the feeling of WEIGHT it gives the player is a master's touch. Every attack has incredible consequences, and every attack is FELT by both players. It has inertia, it has weight, it makes you feel powerful.

Space Marine won't give you that feeling. You'll be flailing a sword around like it was made of paper. You'll be able to cancel most attacks into a guard stance, as if your character didn't have anything in his hands. You don't have the feeling of inertia that a 1.5 ton boi should have. Instead, you'll flail.

Aassholee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aassholee/,"The narrative is shorter than Space Marine 1 (6 missions vs 18. The 6 missions in Operations just give different perspectives of the same narrative through other people). However, it -is- still a very fun and engaging story. By the final mission, my friends and I were looking around and talking about the implications of what we see and we were all like ""This is -BAD-, we gotta stop this!""

The main story is fun in multiplayer, and feels like it was designed with it in mind, but it's still good fun in single player as I've tested it, and the AI companions are more than capable of holding their own. Operations mode is multi-player only, and those levels actually feel better designed likely because they're meant to be played with randoms.

The PVP feels good some of the time, but the third-person perspective can lead to some silly situations, like losing engagements where the enemy comes out from behind the left side of a wall, and can see you first, but you can't see him because of the camera placement. That, and snipers are scoped-in with a first-person perspective so they don't have that problem. I hope the kinks are worked out there, but lets be honest here: no one wanted this game for the PvP!

But while we're on the topic... You can play as Chaos in PvP only. But there's no armor customization options, only re-colors. That sucks tremendously.

ALSO, THIS GAME IS VERY BEEFY. OLD LAPTOPS AND COMPUTERS WILL STRUGGLE!! My Nvidia 1070Ti can play on low preset with ~50 FPS. Sometimes lagging during real-time cutscenes or effects-heavy events.

2) Multiplayer... that is (so far) a mixed bag. I loose connection to the servers regularly. Either from the hub to the mission or back - sometimes (2 times so far ) in the middle of the mission.

ringoshun,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ringoshun/,"This game is sick but just a heads up there is no wide screen support on launch, so annoying black bars on both sides of the screen. Popular program that works around this issue doesn't provide support yet. This also makes it so you can't lock onto your targets unless you play in windowed mode, I didn't know that until after finishing the entire campaign. Length of campaign is decent, I've seen negative reviews claiming it's short, but that's simply not true. PvE and PvP modes contribute significantly to replay ability and feature more advanced customization options. I had no issues with performance. This game will be taking up a lot of my time for sure. I'm not saying its lacking, but I hope to see the developers add more content over time.",Recommended,619,13.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The combat can take some getting used to, but after a mission or two you've got it pretty good. If you do decide to play Operations, I'd highly recommend finding some buddies to play with, as the AI is pretty brain dead for the most part.

As for the PvP, I'm sure it would be fun if I ever got to play more than 2 seconds of anything but staring at a death screen. There is a huge issue of the other team just being able to sit inside of your spawn and spawn camp you. Playing any game mode but the TDM mode is good, but I would avoid the TDM like a jar of mayo with a condom at the bottom.

I wish that the customization was a little bit more in depth as well, as I typically play Salamanders (who have onyx black skin) or Carcharodons (Who have grey, shark like skin) but your Astartes skin tone is locked to whatever class you're playing.

etc_null,https://steamcommunity.com/id/etc_null/,"GLORY AND HONOUR BROTHERS!

We have before us, the greatest hoard shooter in years.

After GW sh!tting the bed for many years, Sabre Interactive has graced us with the Bloodiest, Manliest, Xenos-killin'ist shooter since Gears of war on the xbox 360.
Every swing of your blessed chainsword feels like it has the weight and gravitas that it deserves for being something wielded by a 9ft tall superman. Every round of the holy bolter chimes in the chorus of metal jet bullets fired into some poor bastards skull. Every execution, a glorious spray of blood and viscera as your space marine dismembers the foul creature with his bare hands.

Combat is a tense dance of evading enemy projectiles, parrying larger enemies for a counter hit and perfect rolling away from deadly attacks. Armour and grey-health are restored upon melee or pistol execution so it often becomes a frantic search for a dying xenos to eviscerate while dodging the entire hoard. When you're not running for dear life, you are cutting through hoards of the enemies with blade and hammer turning the smallest of the brood into red mist so you can focus your attention of the bigger xenos that are casting psykic spells or throwing bombs at you.

Alongside a well made Single/(coop) campaign, there is also (coop) Spec ops missions and pvp deathmatch.

This game was very clearly made by a talented team that love and respect the source materiual. Every cut-scene is a love letter to warhammer 40k and its grand legacy (that shall not be tainted by the traitorous scum within!). Meanwhile the gameplay itself hold lasting weight and competency, showing that these guys simply know how to make a good old fashioned: Damn fun game.

Game runs well on pc. Gtx 2080ti / i7-9700kf / Debian 12 / Proton 9.
After rebinding parry to my mouse thumb button the default pc controlls were pretty good as well. I wouldn't want to aim with anything other than a mouse and using the RMB to melee clicks after a few hours.

This game makes me feel like a kid again who just booted up his xbox and loaded up gears of war for the first time.

this game is set in a universe i adore just to add on to all the brainless fun I had playing the story.

The story is dull, uninspired, predictable nonsense you could ever wright but ♥♥♥♥... I would be lying if i said i didn't have fun and didn't like it.

The PvE is fun but can get repetitive since we only have 6 missions, but it's still somehow fun to replay the missions over again.

The multiplayer PvP is super tacked on and generic as hell but again... I love it.
It's just something about going back to simpler executions for games that strikes something in me that adores this game to bits.

Idk what the HELL saber interactive put in this game but i need more",Recommended,716,16.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

-The story was not perfect but I still had a lot of fun with it.
-PvE missions are very nice and I can't wait until they add more.
-PvP is absolutely great. Comes very close to the feeling of the first game.
Sadly they are only 3 maps right now and it's only 6v6.

Only really negatives that I have (that I hope will be addressed in the near future) are the customization.
The available colours are pretty limited right now, which I assume stems from the way how you unlock them.
Some armor part details like laurels, skulls and so on have a weird gold undertone even if you just want to put a matte blue, green or red on it.
And the Chaos Space Marines in the PvP have almost zero customization. I hope they really fix that in the very near future.

TLDR: It's not a perfect game and the developers need to turn some screws, add more customization stuff, more PvP maps and even more PvE missions, but it's still a safe recommendation and worth the money.",Recommended,796,66.4 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

IrreverentIcarus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IrreverentIcarus/,"The campaign (features co-op) is fun and spectacular with some surprising elements.

Ops (PvE co-op) are good as part of your initial campaign playthrough, otherwise it's just repetitive. The system should have been scrapped and missions should've just been baked into the campaign proper.

Eternal War (PvP) can be surprisingly fun, but it's lacking in the technical. Game is built around P2P, so some matches can be played nicely, and others are a disaster. Dedicated servers were needed yesterday.

Very scummy move of the developers to make you pay for colors in DLC for chapters you can unlock otherwise.

The graphics are a spectacle to behold. Bloody and bombastic the combat is similar to gears of war in a lot of ways, but no cover. Although there is a decent selection of weapons, the combat does feel a bit too similar all through the game. That said, it's quite satisfying regardless. Overall, a recommended purchase for Warhammer enthusiasts or folks who enjoyed SM1 or gears of war.

Biggest downside is there's nothing new or exceptional here. It's a well-made hack and slash/shooter but it has little depth for those seeking tactics or character builds.

76561199486162965,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199486162965/,"As a 40k fan, I was thrilled to dive back into the grimdark universe with Warhammer 40k Space Marines 2. The game delivers an exhilarating blend of brutal combat and rich lore that will resonate deeply with franchise fans. Here’s a breakdown of my experience:

Gameplay & Mechanics:
The core of Warhammer 40k: Space Marines lies in its intense, fast-paced combat. Playing as a Space Marine, you get to wield various heavy weaponry and unleash devastating attacks on hordes of enemies. The gameplay remains engaging throughout, satisfyingly balancing shooting, melee combat, and tactical decision-making. However, one aspect I felt was missing was a cover system. In a universe where strategic positioning is crucial, having the ability to take cover would have added an extra layer of depth to the combat.

Story & Atmosphere:
The narrative is a standout feature. The story is compelling, capturing the essence of the Warhammer 40k universe with its dark, epic tone. The plot draws you into the conflict and keeps you invested in the fate of the Space Marines. Fans of the lore will appreciate the attention to detail and how the story immerses you in the grim realities of the 41st millennium.

Technical Aspects:
I did encounter a few minor bugs along the way, which occasionally detracted from the overall experience. While these were generally not game-breaking, they were noticeable and could impact immersion. Additionally, the absence of achievements for completing Veteran mode was a letdown. For a game that celebrates its challenging gameplay, having achievements tied to higher difficulty levels would have been a rewarding incentive for players looking to test their skills.

Overall:
Despite a few flaws, Warhammer 40k: Space Marines is a fantastic addition to the franchise. It captures the essence of the Warhammer universe with its gripping story and thrilling combat, even if it could benefit from some quality-of-life improvements. For fans of Warhammer 40k, this game is a must-play, offering a satisfying blend of lore and action. If you overlook the minor bugs and the lack of a cover system, you’re in for a solid and enjoyable experience.",Recommended,1821,20.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

I didn't want anything to do with the Warhammer 40K universe until one of my friends gifted me a copy of SM2.

I can only say that I missed this type of game. It's simple yet extremely fun. Also made me want to learn the lore behind this Universe and what everything means so that's something.

As for performance, it runs really well for a big game on day one. Far better than EA's or Ubisoft's garbage. With a R7 5700X3D and an RX 7800XT I can max out the game at native 1440p and still get upwards of 80fps.

Multiplayer PvE experience is fun but cannot match the likes of vermintide, Deeprock Galactic etc. mechanics just arent there and animations are clunky so you will often be put in a vulnerable position with no way out (no animation cancelling).

76561197975464456,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975464456/,"TLDR: The art, animation and sound teams carry this game.

It's weird that I'm 80 hours in and haven't already written a review for this game.

Almost all of my time has been in operations, the game's PvE multiplayer mode. With that as context:

1. The matchmaking is atrocious. Problems range from very long load times between sections (loading from your ship to someone else's ship requires reloading all of the assets from that map, even though it's exactly the same map?) to matchmaking simply not working at all. Frequently you get silently taken out of the matchmaking queue and the game stops even trying to match you with people. You have to quit to the main menu and load back in to fix that.

On top of all of that, the game limits Operations to one of each class, but the matchmaking doesn't account for that limitation. It will indiscriminately dump you in matches where someone already has the class you have selected

2. Combat is gorgeous, visceral and crunchy. It's also horrendously designed.

To get a perfect parry, you have to parry at the start of an attack. To get a perfect dodge, you dodge at the end of an attack. Not a huge deal, but very unintuitive.

The upgrade system for weapons is super pointless. It's your normal babby's first game design stat inflation system. You get more powerful, your enemies get tougher, the equivalence stays more or less the same.

I would've much preferred a system where enemies and weapons were just what they were, unlocks were cosmetics only, and higher difficulties required managing larger groups of enemies. As it is, the upgrade system is an unbalanced stat nightmare and enemies on higher difficulties are extremely bullet-spongy.

Speaking of, the iconic bolt weapons feel terrible. They look at sound amazing (with the exception of the bolt pistol. It sounds like a 9mm), but it takes entire of bolt rounds to kill medium sized enemies. I understand why this is the case from a game-play perspective (they want to encourage melee), but it just feels bad. I would prefer a system where enemies are less spongy and more plentiful.

Fighting Thousand Sons is an exercise in absolute frustration. This game is at it's best when you're mixing melee with ranged, dodging and parrying. It's cinematic.

Thousand Sons, as an enemy faction, is completely anathema to that. Tzaangors are unrealistically tanky and shielded gors will just sit and eat bolter rounds all day. Rather than engaging in glorious melee, if you do try to close on a Rubric Marine, they'll shoot you the entire way in and when you finally get to them, they'll teleport away.

So you're forced to engage in ranged battles in a game that doesn't really have sufficient tools for that. You're too fragile to just stand there and tank incoming fire, but there's usually no cover available. Enemies don't spawn in from any specific direction: they usually just appear all around you. The end result of all of this is your team taking fire from all directions, unable to meaningfully close on enemies to force a melee engagement, all the while being harassed by hordes of invincible Tzaangors. It's a miserable slog.

The biggest complaint I have about combat is to do with horde management; namely, that there isn't any. You're constantly surrounded by smaller enemies and they attack constantly from all sides and each attack takes off a full segment of armor. Space Marines are made of paper in this game. You have extreme tunnel vision from the very narrow and unadjustable default field of view, so you simply cannot see what is around you. Hordes of gaunts should be a nuisance: an appetizer for the main course of larger, stronger enemies, but that's not at all how things actually play out. Five or six medium sized Tyranids is an engaging and dynamic fight, but a horde of little gaunts will chew right through you with no issues.

3. Balance in general is not great. Some classes (the bulwark, for example) are extremely overpowered, while others (assault, specifically) is broken to the point of being non-functional. The melta is so much more effective than other ranged weapons that no one uses anything else. The thunder hammer looks and sounds incredible, but it hits like a wet noodle. It's just a mess.

I'm giving this a thumbs up because I waited a decade for a sequel to Space Marine and the fact that it HAS a mode like Operations is excellent. But the actual implementation leaves a lot to be desired.",Recommended,3700,95.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

focalroc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/focalroc/,"As someone who has never engaged in any way with Warhammer 40k content before playing this game, I can definitely say that I only barely understand what's going on. With that said, some of my Warhammer-savvy friends have expressed a great deal of appreciation for the lore accuracy and finer detail of many aspects of the game, and I'm happy to take their word for it. Gameplay wise, this title, as one of my friends put it, ""plays like an Xbox 360 game in all of the best ways"". He is completely correct in this assertion, based on my experience thus far.

Space Marine 2 presents you with a wider variety of gameplay mechanics than you could ever expect from a conventional shooter, and each of them proves to be well made and thoroughly balanced. None of these mechanics overstay their welcome (though the story begins to drag on towards the climax), and most of them can be experienced much more readily in the non-campaign modes of the game. While the story is somewhat shorter-ended, the detail in every mission and the number of supplementary missions (operations) more than make up for it. There's a lot of replayability here, based on difficulty and loadout, as well as just developing your own skill level.

My predominant complaint is that, in the cooperative mode of the story, the loot density does not seem to have been accurately adjusted to sustain three separate player characters. Healing items in particular are extremely few and far between - which may force you to throw away the Space Marine power fantasy for a brief time in favor of just actually trying to stay alive long enough to see the next section of the level.",Recommended,1356,7.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

With that out of the way, I do need to be fair and acknowledge that the game is not perfect.

While the gameplay feels great, there are some balancing issues that allow the cracks to show. Certain enemies, which I will not spoil, don't feel like they mesh well with the gameplay system, further exacerbated by the lack of cover. I don't feel like it makes the game unplayable, but it is less fun on higher difficulties. I recommend playing on Normal for your first go.

1. Healing - Healing is absolutely stupid, you can only heal through stims or damaging enemy's after you've been hit, sounds great in theory but if you get swarmed by little enemy's and someone shooting at you, you just end up at low health for a long time until you find a stim that barely heals you at that, and on top of that armor takes around 30 seconds to naturally regenerate, the health problems NEED to be addressed.

2. Enemy spawning - Spawn locations for enemy's are atrocious, you will complete a wave of enemy's just to end up having a bunch spawn behind you with no heads up; I've died multiple times to heavy units in later levels that spawn directly behind me while we are moving areas

3. Repetitive content - not really a complaint but the PVE multiplayer is extremely repetitive, and the levels are also very linear, would be nice to see new levels added in the future and make them a bit more open

4. Unlock system - The cosmetic unlock system uses the same currency for unlocking perks and weapons, so you end up having to choose between unlocking new weapons or the high priced armor colors and decals

Campaign: Short (6-9 hours max), sweet, and highly cinematic. Decent enough storyline for a 40k game, voice acting is superb. No complaints here really. Feels like they're set up for a broad range of potential, very exciting DLC's (not in a bad way).

Operations: very fun with friends, extremely replayable, feels they just need to add more, same as Darktide on release. You *can* play campaign missions with friends as well obviously, but you won't get online cosmetic/perk unlocks doing this. It's a little annoying there's no private lobby option, but that's on the roadmap to be added very soon anyways.

PVP: Probably the ""weakest"" part of the game right now, feels a little tacked on and barebones. However it is exceedingly fun in a very 2012-ish vibe. Pretty fast matches, no SBMM meaning you're not constantly against sweats, team retainment between matches. They could honestly add just like 6 or so more maps and a few more game-types for variety (why is there no 3v3 option?) and I'd be pretty happy.

Performance: in my experience (3080 + 5800X3D at 4K so granted not a weak system) this is one of the smoothest releases I've seen in a long time, which is very impressive for such a beautiful game. I genuinely don't think I've noticed any frame-drops even when all heresy is breaking loose, and after the hotfix for CPU utilisation my PC wasn't turning into a space-heater either. Servers can definitely be a little janky, more noticeable when playing with friends across the pond or via crossplay, but I'm hopeful this will stabilise as they correct for the number of people playing.",Recommended,1469,33.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Last time I played a campaign like this was during the Halo 1-3 years. The Co-op ""Operations"" mode offers some replayability but think of it more as a Vermintide/Darktide-lite. PvP offers many more hours of fun but is built a little more of as a side activity and shouldn't be the primary decision for your purchase. Extremely solid game that will probably not become your new ""main"" game but offers an experience that is great to play a few hours here and there on a regular basis.

dindinhindipogi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dindinhindipogi/,"I can say they spent effort polishing it before releasing it (I usually don't buy new games as more often than not, newly release games are full of bugs and in an unfinished state)

Story : Story is okay, if you're not a warhammer 40k fan you can still get what is happening and follow along, but it is definitely a plus if you know the lore.

Gameplay: Mechanics are good and balance, game is really hard on max difficulty BUT they will give you tools to beat it and it has a high skill ceiling for those looking for challenges.

Performance: I have Ryzen 5 2600 and 2060 with 32gb ram. I can say I have a constant 50-60 fps at 1080 resolution. There are scenes or times that I have a low FPS of 30 but it is rare and will quickly go away.

Game modes: Campaign, PVE and PVP. I have only tried the campaign and operations mode and I am liking it so far.

-There are no options to play with bots on Operations mode. It is possible but other players may still join you at any time/moment.

It embodies what made the first game good and builds on it. The gameplay is solid, there's a variety of weapons, and the story is deeper and has better character moments than the first. Also the boss fights are much better. The biggest downside is that executions don't heal you, but just replace armor however, you are invincible during executions which is nice.
It should be noted that for me, and some other people, the ping is super high in offline singleplayer and multiplayer despite having great internet. I have no clue what is causing it, but it seems to be on Saber server's side.

The attention to detail is incredible, and it really honors the Warhammer lore in a way that is easy to appreciate.
The storyline is super engaging, and the animations bring the world to life in a way that just feels right. Plus, the soundtrack? It’s absolutely epic!

The UI and controls are user-friendly, making it easy to dive right in. And can we talk about the level design? It’s mind-blowing—I've spent way too much time just admiring the environments.

Everything about the game—from the assets to the code stability—shows that the team put a lot of love and effort into it. You can tell there’s some fantastic skill and teamwork behind the scenes.

The base campaign is a blast, though I definitely wouldn’t have complained if it were a bit more to it (isn’t that always the case with great games?).

Also, the Operations system was a brilliant decision. It’s an MMO-style LFG and instance system where you can drop in and play a mission that progresses weapon, class skills. I very rarely write reviews, but this game really warrants a shout out. It certainly is worth purchase price.

The long term possible plans for this game are pretty wide open, dlc for more base campaigns, new operations maps. Adding the remaining races and classes from WH40K.

I envision a DLC to where the Astartes are putting down the orc hoards led by Gorgutz with new operations maps. Dakka Dakka!

yenahyeyenahyenah,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yenahyeyenahyenah/,"It's a definite successor from the first, and a lot of aspects of the game are incredibly enjoyable. Some have criticised the story, but this is because of a lack of playtime on the operations (basically, main story is conjoined with operations that are undertaken by other spacemarines i.e. co-op, which explains various things that take place in the main story.)

There are some things, might be a skill issue who knows - the lack of 'healing' since its only in the form of pickups and their 'bloodborne aggression' mechanic (you take hit, you get white bar - deal damage, regain some of that health back.) Likewise, it would be nice to have some achievement unlockables, such as completing the game on certain difficulties, or having distinct achievement unlockables, like completing the game on the highest difficulty, or not going down once the entire game etc.

Overall, very good - i hope they expand on this game like Vermintide, i.e. adding onto one game overtime so it becomes a complete package, rather than segmenting it into another game, as like Darktide/Vermintide/Dawn of War, this is one of those warhammer games that aren't just a cashgrab using the warhammer title - its actually good!",Recommended,1004,25.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

iWaffle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iWaffle/,"Currently I feel like I had a better time with Saber Interactive's other game, World War Z, but this game has the WH 40K advantage to it, which should help it sustain itself longer than WWZ.

The environment design, as far as Warhammer 40K environments go, is nothing short of amazing.
Movement and combat feels good and weighty, as it should be with space marines - think WWZ but with space marines.
Music is unremarkable - even Darktide had more memorable ambient and battle music.

As with any game, it is only as good as its control interface(s).
The default keyboard & mouse control scheme feels awkward, and ultimately feels like it should've spent more time in the oven.
To be fair, yes, the newer mechanics in this game are new to these developers, but not to other games in existence that have had the same range of actions too, but mapped them to fewer, more concise controls (melee, ADS, shooting, sprinting, dodging, blocking/dodging, abilities).
There is also a dedicated 'sprint' key in this game, which feels redundant since they could've just made a 'walk' key and have everyone sprint all the time instead - like I said all this could've been resolved if they gave it more time to cook, maybe had a few more rounds of quality user testing and feedback, etc.

Mechanics like parrying/blocking could have also been explained better, especially since they can change with weapon upgrades/perks, which could also use better explanation in-game.

The perfect parry window doesn't feel intuitive - it works similar to dark souls where you need to begin the parry earlier and you get punished if you're late, but the saving grace is this game instead forgives you for late parries by turning the parry into a block (that still blocks all damage).
Parries in this game are unlike in Sekiro where your parries are best initiated right at the point of impact/taking damage.

Progression - just like World War Z, the one turn off I have in both games is the amount of grinding you have to do to unlock the better variants of your weapons, skills and equipment. World War Z had the same progression design and at some point they released a bundle of their game with a lot of the equipment already unlocked with extra (progression) currency to boot, probably in hopes of sustaining their dying game. So I imagine this game will have the same bundle released eventually, so if you don't want to grind, I suggest you wait for that to be released and buy that instead.

There are also dumb issues with key rebinding in this game where, for example, if you wanted to rebind the 'E' to 'F', and 'E' was mapped to 2 actions, the game would block you from binding the second one to 'F'.",Recommended,2222,32.0 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

But we're all here for the cool customizations, right? Well, don't know if it has been mentioned already, but cosnidering that customization in multiplayer is such a BIG selling point of the game, it's pretty disappointing to see that if you happen to be part of the chaos team in multiplayer you can basically forget about all the cool stuff you spent hours customizing. I get that the game is named SPACE MARINE, but chaos literally have 0 customization, niente, nada, not even an unlockable skin for the weapons (don't know, something a bit gorier for Khorne, slimier for Nurgle etc.) It's not fun to play in the team of the not-cool kids.
The end of the match doesn't change things either; not only you're stuck in the same team, but with the same people as well, so if a match is unbalanced it will remain so. The only way to change that is to cancel matchmaking and search another one, which luckily only takes seconds, but still, pretty bothering.

KrimZonGold,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KrimZonGold/,"(THIS GAME IS HELLA GOOD) it has all that you need a Campaign, PVE, and PVP 10/10. i my self like playing PVP games more. so this review is about what they can improve on to make it feel better (PS this is my opinion).

1. when i play i feel like my gun is a pee shooter and when i hit a player it feels like im hitting nothing there is a hit marker but nothing else it should feel and sound like im hitting metal and tearing of flesh with every single shot.

2. The sound in general is not loud enough im in a big hunk of metal i should here you from a mile away with every step same with the guns just louder plz, and i played Bodycam i know what loud is and if its to loud for you can just turn it down simple(PS im not deaf).

3. this is a giving PLZ ADD FOV my mans takes up half the screen im not the only one that thinks this.

4. another thing is the assault class when you use the (Q) to use jet pack to go in the air half the time i dont even know if your there please add some sort of sound cue, indicator, or just make it sound louder so i know when im going to get smashed to death like ultramarine weigh like 1000 pound how can i not here them fly in the air with all that weigh.

Even though i feel like theirs some problems the game is still hella fun and if with these changes it would feel even better when i get a kill or when im just walking around being immersed in the 40k world like im a ultramarine with ever shot should have power behind it and with every step should feel like a earth quake.

Pros-
Campaign feel large and grand scale.

Difficulty seems to up to very large extremes, which makes the game play feel real and a struggle.

Online feels well balanced between the classes.

Story for the campaign was amazing, loved fighting with my battle brothers. (give me more but with chaos)

Co op missions are fun and large scale.

Cons-
Three player missions could be upped to four. (I always have one friend left out)

Matchmaking online has to many loading screens and almost impossible to exit between fights. (loading screen then straight into the next battle)

Campaign needs more content. (This is still a pro i'm just greedy and want more content)

Online character customisation, some chaos love please please give the chaos factions a chance to custom there characters further.

Would be great to be able to custom you battle barge, heretic to loyalist. (just saying)

I would give this game a 9/10 this is only missing the extra 1, is because more chaos customisation and more content!
It has been a long long time that i have enjoyed a game like this truly amazing and feels as good as the old games i used to play halo, gears ect and I feel a lot of the new games that release have been lacking.

The game is a battle.
If it's not fun, why bother?
If it's not a battle, where's the fun?

These are the tenets I go by. Space Marine 2 is fun. Incredibly so. The only pain points I have is the story's nothing more than an excuse to shoot aliens and bad guys, and the action-queuing system (I have no better way to describe it) tends to mess you up when you need it the most.

There is, at the time of writing, a 6 mission long campaign stretching across 7-8 hours from feeling, 6 PvE Operation missions where you team up with friends or randos, and 3 PvP gamemodes with 3 maps collectively. Game's pretty barebones and can get stale pretty quick if it weren't for how great the actual gameplay feels.

As much as I hate a live-service approach to delivering content, I do hope that what they've got planned down the line is worth sticking around for. For now, looking at the little plastic dudes on my shelves look this good is enough fanfare to keep me on. I just hope the game's good enough for newcomers to the universe to stick around.

--(Review)--
The game offers a unique combat experience and high replay ability, the campaign and multiplayer are very immersive and cinematic and the classes and content offered offers a large variety and all have good progression paths and variance in ways to play them, on the surface you may see 6 classes, but each has multiple ways to play them and the combination of them on a team makes repeated game play consistently engaging.

For players wanting to only play the story, know that it is relatively short for the price with an average 8 hour play time although the quality of the story and the way the lore is respected and utilized in unique ways made the story very interesting and was a great jumping off point for my friends just starting war hammer, allowing them to ask many questions about the lore and and explore a wide variety of it.

For Multiplayer PVP players I would recommend that you wait, the PVP is very fun and feels fair and balanced, i've seen every class get top of the leaderboard at least once, but the main issue is a lack of maps, which for $60 isn't enough if this is all you plan to play.

Overall it seems the main focus was put into the multiplayer PVE and this created a very satisfying and fun multiplayer experience that has it's unique takes on combat and gun play that make trying different play styles very rewarding without forcing you using push tactics. The campaign holds it's value and the PVP is a fun change of pace, and for $60 if you plan on playing all of this content it feels very complete and is a great package of content that seems to be already planned to be expanded upon.

--(Key Points)--
-Unique and Engaging Combat System
-Cinematic and Diverse Set Pieces and Maps
-Very Lore Friendly and great starting point to learn about universe
-Engaging Multiplayer and Heavy Replay ability
-AI Director has a similar feel to the tide games in the good ways

--(Key Negative Points)--
-Shorter Campaign
-Not enough Multiplayer PVP Map Diversity
-Objectives in PVE maps do not have enough variance when replaying same mission
-Technical issues but I did not see them, I recommend you read reviews that touch on that better to get a fuller picture

(Feedback/Content-Suggestions)

Add a Psyker class the way I see it Heavy/Sniper are ranged focus, Assault/Vanguard are melee focus, Tactical is Universal and Bulwark is Support, Psyker would offer unique gameplay that falls under the support category, such as debuffing enemies, using telekinesis to weaponize smaller enemies against terminus enemies or debuff enemies with various status effects

Allow coloring of cloth, this should be an option for Bulwark Sniper and Tactical as currently I'm picking my colors to match my cloth and not the other way around.

Executions that utilize Heavies Guns would be cool as only the base grabs are used currently


Thank you for making such an immersive and complete world, that was not scared to utilize unique systems to make a more engaging and satisfying experience!",Recommended,2533,65.8 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

The gameplay is very simple but so enjoyable, when you combine it with a great world building and a good story it just feels amazing. Plus the animations of glory kills are so satisfying.

Operations are very good, there are only 6 for now but there are some variables in them (sometimes the ennemies don't attack from the same flank or you have to activate another computer for example, it helps with replayability). At high difficulties it's really a challenge to beat them and it's very cool to play with friends.
It would have been cool lore-wise to explain why you can play as a blood angels (for example) in those since you can customize your space marine but since the game is centered around ultramarines it kinda feels weird (still it's a small detail).

I don't know what to think about PvP. It's really laggy sometimes, some classes are useless, some are too strong for me.
Also the lack of customisation for chaos is poor and I know that a lot of people would like more.

I can't wait to see where this game leads us and I hope future Warhammer games will have this level of finition !",Recommended,961,40.2 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

From the moment you start, you really do feel like a Space Marine.
The combat is brutal and satisfying, with melee attacks feeling visceral and weighty.
The sound effects and music capture the atmosphere of the 41st millennium absolutely.

The game is challenging, especially on the highest difficulty setting.
Shooting is effective but often you'll find yourself surrounded by hordes of enemies, making melee combat a necessity. Engaging in close-quarters battles is exhilarating, as you smash through ranks of foes with ruthless efficiency.
The visuals are stunning, immersing you in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium. Every texture, model and animation fits the feeling of the game.

While the single-player campaign (can be played in co-op) offers variety and a good story, it's the multiplayer modes that truly shine. Operations provides a robust co-op experience, letting you team up with other players to tackle challenging scenarios. Endless War mode is a PvP experience that feels different with each of the classes.

As you level up, you unlock new abilities, acquire better weapons and armor, and alter your appearance. The armor customization is particularly impressive, with dozens of options to personalize your look.

Overall, this game is a must-play for any fan of Warhammer 40,000. It delivers on its promise of an authentic, immersive 40K experience, with plenty of challenges and replay value to keep you engaged.",Recommended,1269,39.1 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

Did you play gears/army of two or similar games with friends back in the day?

This game is for you.

Firstly the game reminds me of what we lost on the altar of GAAS and time waster filled crap that Ubisoft started years ago. Campaign is short but really action packed. The spectacle of it all is jaw dropping.

Graphics look seriously great, if you are tabletop 40k fan you can seriously spend a long time just looking at terrain and recognizing tabletop ruins pieces.

When you beat campaign PVE mode awaits which - yes - needs more maps but feels seriously fun to play and presents a challenge to overcome when you first start it.

There are some kinks to work out like matchmaking issues, few annoying crashes etc. but i have faith it will all be fixed sooner than later.

If you are a 40k nerd this game is for you. If you feel nostalgic about games that used to value your time and not make you reach for your credit card every 30 minutes this game is definitely for you.

I'm a 40k fan, have the models and played other 40k titles. Space Marine 1 is a great game, and this game definitely exceeds its predecessor. The attention to detail of NPCs and the environment is massive, compared to the first. The gothic details of the infrastructure and the environment are on point. The environment is much more animated and vibrant compared to Forge World Graia in the first instalment.

STORY
The game does a good job of applying the exposition of the Tyranids and Chaos so if you're new to 40k, you won't be like ""Huh? Wtf are they on about?"" Although you may be a bit perplexed as to why they speak the way they do. You will soon get used to it.

I'm currently playing this on the hardest difficulty and oh boy is it a great way to experience the grim dark universe of 40k. There have been that many times when I have been downing wave after wave by the skin of my teeth, with a tiny sliver of health left. Thinking that was the last wave, lol nope. Its been enjoyingly frustrating and difficult at times. If you have some patience and enjoy a challenge, I recommend it. If you're more into the story, don't have to. Play how you want to play, who cares what other people say.

Haven't done any multiplayer as of yet.

I love how they have named characters from 40k lore in this, as well as even basing some of the appearences of NPCs off of 40k miniatures. Great attention to detail. The major story cutscenes are really high end. Just like watching something off of Warhammer TV.

I look forward to a sequel and playing multiplayer. Here's hoping we don't have to wait another 14 years for it",Recommended,1384,3.7 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

PVE is really fun and challenging and can definitely bring hours of enjoyment. my only issue is PVP is PC only and i cant play with my console buddies. i know some think pc has an unfair advantage or on the flip side aim assist is unfair. but i genuinely think thats such a minority that its not a big deal while i can see a lot more people complaining they cant play with their friends who have consoles. especially since if you and your friends finsh all of PVE or get bored of it you cant switch now. And yall are stuck to PVE unless your friend gets PC or You get the console version. other than that PVP is amazing and hell of a time. theres so much to the combat and gameplay that there defintely is a difference between a skilled player and an alright player but not so different where the alright player cant get better or continue to lose.

Okay, but really, i LOVE this game, from the story to the gameplay to even the multiplayer, its all so well connected and just good.

First off, the story, but it puts on an amazing B plot i wont go into detail on, and i love how each of the characters interact and find out about how Titus was accused of corruption, overall, the story is amazing, and calls back to the first game over 10 years ago.

Next off the weapons and gameplay, ranged is moreso a supplement to melee, but melee is amazing, being able to go from absolutely mauling a swarm of tyranids, to then parrying a warrior and getting a gun kill on it, it all flows into itself so well. The weapons themselves are all distinct enough to be worthy of being different, from fire rate and magazine increases to being a literal flame shotgun.

Finally, the multiplayer, this is the weakest part of the game, but it is still good, so, there's a lot of connection issues currently, not as bad as Helldivers 2, but still some minor bugs, such as getting stuck in the battle barge when a player is connecting and you start the mission. It is all manageable though, and is soon to be fixed alongside the addition of private games (hopefully).

Overall, this game is a 9/10, if they add more co-op and PVP missions, itll be an easy 10/10",Recommended,1093,22.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

RabTriangle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RabTriangle/,"I ended this game campaign with my friend in angel of death difficult.

this game is very intense playing with friend yet also very challenge when you solo

-campaign-
The story is abit short but the inner of character can make you feel so important in the story and thats a great point.

enemies AI are well made some of them not just goes straight to you even they are just low tier, they will surround you at all cost they can do, bigger enemies can give you are hard time when they are not just one they do really dog fight on you as much as they want you dead.

there is some small detail that make you feel impress like ""the guardman can be respawn as well also they have a reasonable spot to respawn""

-operation-
is a grinding game here you might need times for getting better skill and weapon to be at the top like usual grinding game.

is it harder than campaign?
absolutely is. enemies are randomize spawn rate yet also the operation are randomized path as well.

lucky when one of your team died the game will not role back to checkpoint like the campaign mode. ""just dont get aced"" if all your team are downed the mission ended. simple as that just ""dont die""

-eternal war-
it is a pvp mode in this game like the first one.

im not a fan of pvp but the game is quite fair. pick your class effect on your team fight is very matter in it.
team up in this mode is very important i having a fun time playing as a vanguard to stop enemies shielding their team as my team run their bolters on the bulwark.

We enjoyed the ride a lot and we wanted more. Personally, I think the length of the story was perfect: it didn't overstay it's welcome and didn't want to tell too much or too little. The visuals are a spectacles and diverse, the characters were well written and well acted and there's just the right amount of lore.
The melee combat feels a bit clunky and inconsistent, especially on the parry but the more I played, the better I got and the better it felt.

Just play it.

76561198057435668,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057435668/,"Absolutely love the Campaign, as an original Space Marine player from 2012. Combat is satisfying, range of weapons hits the spot. It is going to take me a while to become proficient at melee and learn the attack patterns of all the new opponents.
Online (PvE) is also satisfying so far. There is a nice levelling system for your equipment and lots of customisation available for people like myself that prefer to see the Black Templars Chapter. Some people criticise a lack of ammo and dying too much, but that's the reality of the 40k universe even as a Space Marine. Everything is out to get you and even a regular Tyranid can do some damage to a regular Space Marine. Even if you are a longer ranged Sniper you need to sometimes get your hands dirty with your Combat Knife.
There is still a lot about this game I am discovering and even if I give up after another 15 hours of gameplay I think it was worth it to see this second instalment of Space Marine. Also keep in mind that the original Space Marine game didn't have Exterminatus on release (my favourite game mode), so there could be some chances of additional missions, game modes and other new content on the horizon for this game.
Also, if you're joining a game of PvE, don't expect other players to be able to hear your microphone. By default the volume of the weaponry you're using is going to drown out whatever the hell you're saying. Don't get upset with players who don't seem to be listening to what you're saying, they probably can't hear you over the sounds of the brutal executions and bolter explosions... LOL

but it's cute to run into a swarm of enemies and malee them

it would be a great game to play with friends if you have a group of them that you play together
i think it's great for that purpose

but otherwise it's just a fun little game not life changing in any way

76561198201416041,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201416041/,"I personally love this game when it works. When this game works it's amazing and love every second of it.

Campaign: Game play is fun and addicting and I love how much more in depth the mechanics are compared to the first. The story is far better than the first as well, I love the characters far more. TItus is so much better than the first game and it hooks you right away. I've been playing the campaign co op and it's how it should be played. We've been playing it on Angel of Death difficulty (the hardest difficulty) and honestly I feel the game is to easy. The tutorial was the hardest part of the campaign trying to learn the mechanics and by yourself it felt like the odds were against you. After that the game is basically smooth and pretty easy which kinda disappointed me. Yes we died but it made sense but it didn't feel hard at all. Most bosses we beat on the first try and I didn't feel that I felt challenged which I would like. I haven't beat the campaign fully yet and I'll get to why. So far though the game is amazing and awesome and in my opinion worth the buy for the campaign alone.

Operations: I've only played one match of operations because they're other space marines stories along side the main campaign and it's exactly what I wanted. The game caters to your play style and gives you the options to play 6 different classes and I enjoy the insane customization for your space marine. In the first mission they did reuse some areas of the base campaign but very little most of the areas is new and I'm glad. So far I'm excited to keep going on it.

PVP: Now this is insanely lacking, I really enjoy the multiplayer and I love the maps and how the gameplay transitions to multiplayer. Now for the negatives on this the maps are seriously lacking. 3 MAPS? How do we only have 3 MAPS? The argument is ""their focus is PVE"" if that's the case don't add multiplayer, 3 maps and only two are memorable then only 3 game modes? It's ridiculous that this game is severally lacking when we could've had so much more stuff within the game that other games had because none of the modes are unique, It's TDM, Domination, and Hardpoint, that's it. I would like to see maybe a game mode where we play the tyranids against 6 Space Marines similar to Gears of War's Beast mode, better maps, balancing on health since I feel like grenades are overpowered, I've thrown it at two enemies who are full health and kills them instantly and they're two different classes with different armor protections. Snipers are inconsistent in multiplayer and really don't feel the best. Progression for weapons in my opinion is pretty slow and with only 3 modes and 3 maps it's going to get boring fast. Thankfully there's a good amount of weapons. My biggest issue though is that the Chaos marines don't have much customization. Most classes have a few weapons and you can't customize any of them, you can't even customize the armor sets and it feels very tacked on. I'm very disappointed and this needs severe changes if not this isn't gonna last like COD's DMZ mode, potential but didn't have the same effort put in. Another issue is constant disconnecting from servers on Sabers end. Just today (9/13/2024) I went in to play pvp and it took me 15min of trying to fix the game to connect just to play 1 game and then loading into the 2nd my game freezes and crashes probably for the 20-30th time owning this game.

Lastly the cons and there's big cons to this game. For the price point and handful delays we shouldn't be getting a buggy mess with so many bugs it makes me want to refund the game. I'm running a RTX 3060 and a Ryzen 5 5600X running mostly High and medium settings, at 1080p and a 165HZ monitor and I've had massive issues. The game is downloaded on a 2T SSD specifically a Samsung-970 EVO Gen 3x4 NVMe and my game crashes every time I play. I will open up the game and instant freeze sometimes taking up to 10min to unfreeze itself. Sometimes it freezes so long I have to click the power button on my PC to turn it off. I thought I was a handful of people but I guess a lot of people playing the game has the same issue. This isn't one game mode it's every game mode I play. Crossplay makes the game bug out causing my friends on the Series X or PS5 have issues joining or having to reset due to them stuck on loading. I probably have the freeze issue happen 3-9 times a day and it is the most infuriating thing of all time. I want to play the game I enjoy it but this makes me feel that the game should be $30. Not $60 or $75 for console with tax. I am a consumer and expect the product to work well at least. This age of games is frustrating having to deal with delay after delay and the game to come out so buggy. If you don't want you immersion to be sucked out so often I would wait til they fix these issues. They have a lot of things to fix and I wouldn't have mind another delay but with a Beta to know the bugs when more people are playing for an extended amount of time because it feels they weren't ready for this launch.

Also add crossplay to PVP I just want to play with my friends who aren't fortunate enough to have PC's the game isn't a twitch shooter like COD it's not an Esports type of game, it's a fun pvp just let me play with my friends and meet new people who might be on a different console. That's how friendships are made and you shouldn't be limiting players from playing with their friends. Cheaters is always going to be an issue and yes I bet there is going to be sweaty people but there's always gonna be those people so just open the flood gate for cross play and allow a toggle button. You did it for console so just add it for everyone please.

I do think this game is amazing but the bugs are massively the biggest issue and need to be fixed ASAP, I don't care if content is delayed. Expecting a game to work should be the standard not the outlier. PVP issues need to also be fixed and it's embarrassing the state it's in. PVE is the only good state about the game but you'll get the whole experience of maps and game modes of PVP within 2-3hrs of playing. I would give this game 9/10 or 10/10 for how fun it is and is a strong contender for game of the year for me along side Black Myth, but right now the game is in a 6/10 range due to how mad the bugs make me. I spend more time fixing bugs than playing the game. my review is conflicting I'm sorry I love this game it's love hate relationship but tired of bugs being the norm of games now.",Recommended,5257,35.3 hrs on record,Posted: September 14

All of that is worth dealing with because the core gameplay loop is just incredibly fun and addicting. The more repeatable part of the game is the pve operations and right now there are only 6, but the gameplay is so fun I could (and do) just play even one of them over and over again. More specifically the combat flows really well and the multiple ways you can deal with the enemies keeps combat from getting stale. The space marines feel powerful and like any single enemy would be trivial while the game overall is still challenging. I would highly recommend this game if you like the general style of the combat. Additionally if you are a 40k fan, especially a space marine fan, this game is fantastic. My biggest army in the table top is space marines and this game is extra cool because of my interest in the ip so if you like 40k you will enjoy the game more than the average person. Lastly I don't have strong feelings about the pvp. In my opinion what makes this game great is the pve system and a lot of that is inherently different and lost in pvp. Thats not to say pvp isn't fun but it doesn't have most of what, in my opinion, makes this game really good. A lot of people play the pvp and i assume enjoy it.

This game absolutely needed to happen and it was an unexpected surprise for myself

Space Marine (1) was a fantastic romp as a Space Marine and for a while I believe was the only Third Person WH40K game. I absolutely loved it and it was the game aside from DoW that cemented my love for 40K

And thank the Man Emperor this exists. I went into it blind and I left thoroughly satisfied. Like a Tech Priest and a toaster, or Rogal Dorn and good quality wooden furniture.

Lets break it down. My likes and dislikes about the game.

- This game is very pretty to look at and the effects and shadows are some of the best I'd seen in a game for a while. It is, however, somewhat dull and grey sometimes. It maybe my lighting settings, so do take this as a grain of salt

-I love the soundtrack. It's orchestral and epic. What you expect as a Ultramarine. I imagine there are far more fitting soundtracks for other legions, this one works.

-The sound design is on point, I cannot really think of any real issues. I appreciate the clunky noises, although I think Boltgun did a better job at emulating the weight of Astartes power armour

-Even the voice work is really damn good. Clive Standen does a great job as Titus, even if the absence of Mark Strong can be felt. I appreciate the VA work for Gadriel and Chairon, they were powerful secondaries whom I hope to see in a solo campaign expansion in the future, as we never see the early days of a Primaris Marine

-The Operations mode is a welcome addition to the game, as it expands the campaigns plot and makes for fun replayability. I enjoy being able to mix it up with different customisation and classes, I also enjoy the randomness of it as well. I am also fond of the fact that it contributes to cosmetics and offers more reward than PvP and it seems to be the mode most encouraged to indulge in. I do hope in the future we get something similar to the Chaos Rising portion of Space Marine 1 for this game, as it would be nice to have Traitor Legions in the mix with unique classes and abilities in a PvE environment

-I, for one, feel like the combat is very much a combination of the Arkham games, with a dash of DS1 and Force Unleashed. The executions add a fun twist and I like that Beat Em Up aspect with the melee weapons in this game, even if I don't use them a lot of the time. The gunplay also feels good but I wish it felt punchier and weightier overall.

-The story also feels like it hits the right beats and makes sense, but it also still leaves some lingering questions which warrants an expansion or a sequel. It was also nice that the guard was also featured being a Guardsman guy myself.

-Despite my praise of the visuals, there is no excuse for some of the pre launch/advanced access and the day 1 optimisation. There are people who cannot properly play the game at all in some cases and some of the effects, even with high end rigs, will tank your frames. Even if you set it lower, you will feel the particle effects almost turn your PC into molten slag

-The controls need to be fine tuned before you even start the game, it feels odd some of the keybinds, though this is a minor point

-The constant network issues. I cannot stress this enough, it is frustrating to deal with. It is especially frustrating when your friends cannot do PvE.

-There are some major bugs and glitches that need sorting still, especially pertaining to transitioning to the loading screen on PvE or even Co-op Campaign at times. We are also waiting for Ultrawide and that should've been standard for a game of this visual calibre in my opinion.

-Although I have some reservations and criticisms about the PvP, I will say this: Chaos needs to have some customisation options like the Loyalists, especially with the wide array of Firstborn aesthetics. Hell, I'd like some Firstborn callbacks for the Loyalists, although lore wise, it seems Mark X armour supposedly beats out the OG Mark VII and Mark VIII Errant armour in a lot of ways


My biggest issue is in fact the PvP. I cannot stress this enough: It needs to bake longer.
I will elaborate: It felt like it needed more time cooking or at least a beta to figure out the balancing issues. So far, it feels absolutely useless to melee anything that is lighter than a Bulwark or Heavy class, in fact, melee seems to not penalise the other classes at all, there is no staggering and you can just hip fire to counter. I also feel that it should take notes from TF2 and mix the teams up after each round to make it fair, rather than keep the same squad. It feels like this should've been opened up post launch instead of Horde Mode


To sum up, I recommend this game to a casual fan and 40K fans alike. It is one of this years best games, although, I would wait a little while longer until some of the major bugs are fixed or remedied, especially around the point we get private PvE lobbies and Horde mode.",Recommended,4033,55.5 hrs on record,Posted: September 13

This could help you if you're using a 13th or 14th Gen Core i9 or i7 CPU, the root cause of these issues isn't fully clear, since it could be related to high default power and current limits that some motherboards may use.

Proceed to your motherboard's setting for CPU Configuration, locate Long Duration Power Limit (Package if Asus Board) should be set to 243 by default it's set to auto, do the same for Short Duration Power Limit (Package if Asus Board).
Finally, CPU Current Limit should be set to 307, & save exit.

Current Specs:
13th Gen i9-13900K
Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090
32GB Ram DDR5 overclocking @ 7000mhz

Just as an fyi, I'm running this game at 4k, and on a SSD at Ultra Settings.
Hope this helps, and purge this heresy!!!
